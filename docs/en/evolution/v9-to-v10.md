- Chinese source: [../../evolution/v9-to-v10.md](../../evolution/v9-to-v10.md)

## Summary

V10 adds the `IntrospectionSystem` with 4 new tools:
- `introspect_stats` - View behavior statistics
- `introspect_patterns` - Analyze behavior patterns
- `introspect_reflect` - Generate self-reflection reports
- `introspect_logs` - View behavior logs

This enables the agent to observe and analyze its own behavior, the first step toward self-evolution.
