**Speaker 1**: I'm  the  first  official  vibe  coding  engineer  at  Lovable  here  at  the  top . 
**Speaker 2**: point  1%  elite  level  of  vibe  coding.  It's  a  dream  job  for  so  many  people. 
**Speaker 1**: It  became  a  job  by  building  in  public.  You  don't  need  a  pony  to  hire  you  can  hire  yourself  as  a  professional  vibe  coding  first. 
**Speaker 2**: you've  never  coded.  You  don't  want  to  look  at  the  code. 
**Speaker 1**: coding  is  gonna  be  like  calligraphy.  Oh  my  God,  you  wrote  that  code,  that's  so  amazing.  It's  going  to  be  so  rare  that  it's  going  to  become  an  art. 
**Speaker 2**: These  Venn  diagrams  of  engineered  design  Rpm  used  to  be  very  separate,  now  they're  converging  AI  regardless . 
**Speaker 1**: of  your  background  is  an  amplifier,  if  you  don't  know  what  you're  doing,  you're  just  going  to  produce . 
**Speaker 2**: garbage  faster.  Feels  like  an  emerging  core  skill  is  learning  clarity  in  the  ask  of  the  AI. 
**Speaker 1**: I  like  to  use  the  Aladdin  and  the  Genie  analogy,  you  rub  the  lamp,  genie  comes  out.  I'll  grant  you  three  wishes,  the  first  wishes  I  want  to  be  taller,  Genie  makes  me  13  feet  tall  because  I  was  not  specific  AI  just  don't  understand.  What  do  you  mean  when  you  say,  you  know  what  I  mean?  So  you  need  to  be  specific.  I'm  up  using  a  harder  percent  of  my  time  today  on  good  judgment,  clarity,  quality,  taste. 
**Speaker 2**: Today  my  guest  is  Lazar  yovanovich  Lazar  is  a  professional  vibe  coder,  he  gets  paid  to  vibe  code  all  day  and  build  internal  and  external  products.

This  episode  is  brought  to  you  by  Stella,  the  customer  research  platform  built  for  the  AI  era.  Here's  the  truth  about  user  research,  it's  never  been  more  important  or  more  painful.  Teams  want  to  understand  why  customers  do  what  they  do,  but  recruiting  users  running  interviews  and  analyzing  insights  takes  weeks  by  the  time  the  results  are  in  the  moments  act  as  past  strela  changes  that  it's  the  first  platform  that  uses  AI  to  run  and  analyze  in  adept  interviews,  automatically  bringing  fast  and  continuous  user  research  to  every  team  strela's  AI  moderator  asks  real  follow  up  questions,  probing  deeper  when  answers  are  vague,  and  surfaces  patterns  across  hundreds  of  conversations,  all  in  a  few  hours,  not  weeks.  Product  design  and  research  teams  at  companies  like  Amazon  and  Duolingo  are  already  using  strela  for  Figma,  prototype  testing,  concept  validation,  and  customer  journey  research. Getting  insights  overnight  instead  of  waiting  for  the  next  sprint.  If  your  team  wants  to  understand  customers  at  the  speed  you  ship  products,  try  Stella.

If  you  listen  to  this  podcast,  you  know  that  we  spend  a  lot  of  time  talking  about  building  things  that  sit  on  a  screen,  onboarding  funnels,  mobile  apps,  and  checkout  flows.  Some  Sara  is  building  products  for  the  physical  world,  first  responders  racing  to  emergencies,  truck  drivers  carrying  critical  supplies,  construction  workers  building  our  cities  and  data  centers.  These  are  people  who  put  everything  on  the  line  every  single  day,  and  samsas  technology  protects  them  samsara's  solving  complex  problems  at  the  intersection  of  hardware,  software,  and  edge  AI.  And  their  AI  doesn't  just  detect  events.  It  reasons  about  the  intent  and  answers  questions  like,  did  that  truck  driver  break  abruptly  because  they  were  distracted  or  was  that  a  heroic  act?  If  you  want  to  ground  llds  in  messy  real  world  telemetry  or  solve  eji  constraints  at  a  planetary  scale,  some  Sara  wants  to  talk  to  you.  If  you  like  playing  with  enormous  data  sets,  moving  fast,  and  working  in  small  teams,  come  help  build  the  technology  that  makes  the  physical  world  safer  and  more  efficient.

**Speaker 1**: Thanks  for  having  me. 
**Speaker 2**: man.  Okay,  so  ahead,  Elena  Verna  on  the  podcast,  she's  had  to  grow  the  lovable.  She  mentioned  that  she  works  with  a  professional  vibe  coder.  You,  I  had  so  many  questions,  I  almost  wanted  to  like  go  on  a  tangent  with  her,  just  try  to  understand  this  role.  Instead,  I  asked  you  to  come  on  the  podcast.  There's  so  much  I  want  to  talk  about.  I  want  to  talk  about  just  this  career  path  and  just  how  you  got  into  it,  how  other  people  might  get  into  it,  where  you  think  this  is  all  going,  this  whole  vibe  coding  thing.  Also,  I  want  to  get  into  what  you've  learned  about  it  being  successful  using  all  these  AI  tools  because  this  is  your  job. First,  I  want  to  just  start  with  understanding  this  actual  job.  Just  like,  what  is  it  that  you  do  day  to  day?  You're  basically  being  paid  a  full  time  job  to  vibe  code  incredible,  what  are  you  responsible  for,  what  are  you  doing  day  to  day? 
**Speaker 1**: Well,  as  you  said  it,  like  it's  the,  it's  a  dream  job,  right?  I  get  paid  to  do  what  I  would  have  done  anyways,  right?  It's  the  best  job  in  the  world.  I  get  to  use  tools  like  Global  Ball  every  day  to  push  projects  to  production,  whether  for  internal  or  external  use,  those  could  be  ranging  anything  from  like  different  templates  on  marketing  side,  sales  side,  or  whatever,  or  they  can  be  as  deep  as  like  building  some  internal  tools  with  a  lot  of  integrations  and  connections  and  whatnot,  right?  The  surface  area  that  I  cover  is  pretty  wide  across  all  departments  because  it's  such  a  flexible  role  and  it  complements  so  many  things.  It's  an  idea  for  a  lot  of  people,  have  a  lot  of  great  ideas,  but  they  don't  know  how  to  build  them,  or  they  just  don't  have  the  bandwidth  to.  And  that's  where  I  step  in  today  to  make  sure  that  these  ideas  come  to  life  fast  with  quality  and  security  that  they  should  have  in  order  to  be  available  for  users  in  production. 
**Speaker 2**: And  one  thing  that's  really  interesting  here  is  it's  both  internal  and  external  tools.  A  lot  of  companies  have  someone  building  a  bunch  of  internal  tools  using  AI.  You  ship  stuff  that's  actually  public  and  it's  like  sort  of  a  product  level  products. 
**Speaker 1**: Yeah,  definitely  like  some  of  the  stuff  that  I've  shipped  that  are  public  are  like  when  we  launched  our  Shopify  integration,  most  of  the,  if  not  all  the  templates  that  users  were  remixing  were  built  by  me,  right?  So  stuff  like  that  or  like  the  merch  store  because  we  wanted  to  obviously  prove  the  concept  that,  hey,  lovable  and  Shopify  just  works.  It's  so  simple,  anybody  can  do  it.  I  buy  coded  our  merch  store,  so  all  the  merch,  including  this  shirt  that  people  were  buying  online,  they  would  have  bought  it  well  from  a  store  that  was  built  by  me. But  then  on,  again,  on  the  internal  side,  we  want  to  track  a  lot  of  things  like  one  of  the  cool  things  that  we  want  to  build  now,  for  example,  like  feature  adoption  matrix,  like  if  we  build  a  feature,  how  many  people  are  actually  using  it  as  adopting  it?  Like,  and  that's  a  pretty  custom  build,  right?  We  have  a  very  custom  stack.  We're  building  custom  features.  There's  nothing  out  there  that  I  could  just  pick  off  the  shelf  and  build  or  adopt  faster  than  I  would  have  built  it  myself.  Like  at  this  point  I'm  at  a  stage  where  like  if  it  takes  me  an  hour  or  two  hours  to  set  up  like  a  big  press  account  somewhere  I'm  just  going  to  build  it  myself  faster.  So  you  know  i'm  in  that  position  of  like  build  versus  buy.  I'm  in  the  build  boat,  so  to  speak. Yeah. 
**Speaker 2**: and  then  who  do  you  report  to  or  you  kind  of  this  rover  that  helps  wherever  or  you  would  win  a  specific  team? 
**Speaker 1**: I'd  say  probably  closer  to  the  former,  right?  I  started  in  growth,  right?  Elena  brought  me  on  early  on.  And,  you  know,  because  she  has  so  many  great  ideas  and  like  she  just  needed  somebody  with  the  right  type  of  mon  mindset  and  velocity  and  ownership  to  just  take  you,  come  away,  build  them  up,  get  them  into  production,  whether  they're  like  based  on  education  or  anything,  go  to  market  or  whatever.  But  then  obviously  the  when  you're  able  to  ship  fast,  everybody  needs  that  in  an  environment  that  we  as  a  company  are  now  living  in,  which  is  where  the  fastest  growing  startup  in  history.  So  every  department  needs  all  those  are  now  or  yesterday.  So  now  I'm  like  shifting  a  little  bit,  I  guess,  into  something  to  go  to  market  roles  and  even  building  some,  again,  internal  tools  for  enterprise  T,  but  I'm  working  on  some  community  tools  as  well  right  now  as  we  speak.  So  I'm  a  little  bit  all  over  the  place,  but  kind  of  thriving  that  environment  where  like  I'm  given  a  rough  concept,  a  rough  idea,  and  I'm  just  tasked  to  bring  it  to  life  as  soon  as  possible,  okay? 
**Speaker 2**: I'm  hoping  with  this  chat,  we  create  a  lot  more  lazars  and  I  want  to  get  to  the  career  path.  How  you  got  to  this  and  what  it  takes  to  actually  become  a  full  time-time  bike  coder.  But  I  want  to  start  with,  because  you  do  this  full  time,  you're  at  the  top  point  1%  elite  level  of  vibe  coding.  You're  doing  this  full  time,  they  hired,  you  do  this  as  a  job.  I'm  so  curious  what  you've  learned.  What  are  some  pro  tips  that  you've  developed  for  being  successful  with  AI  tools,  lovable,  and  also  just  more  broadly,  what  are  maybe  two  or  three  things  you've  learned  that  and  help  you  be  really  good  at  this  job? 
**Speaker 1**: The  first,  understanding  that  I  had  very  early  on,  even  though  just  in  full  transparency  before  we  begin,  I  don't,  I  don't  have  a  technical  background.  I  never  wrote  a  single  line  of  code  in  my  life,  almost  like  I've  written  a  couple  of  console  logs  manually,  and  that's  about  it,  right?  So  like  I  I'm  very  much  lean  onto  AI  assistance. 
**Speaker 2**: let  me  actually  follow  that  thread  because  that's  such  a  good  point  and  something  that  when  we  were  chatting  earlier,  you  pointed  out  your  feeling  is  it's  actually  an  advantage  to  not  have  a  technical  background  when  you  get  into  this  space. 
**Speaker 1**: Yes,  yes,  I  honestly  feel  that  it  is  because  people  like  me  don't  know  that  they  are  not  supposed  to  be  building  XYZ  and  that's  how  we  actually  are  able  to  build  it. Let  me  give  you  an  example.  Like  6,  7  months  ago,  somebody  in  our  community  was  like,  oh,  I  wish  lovable  can  build  Chrome  extensions,  right?  And  then  folks  that  are  not  technical,  like,  well,  why,  why  is  that  not  possible,  right?  And  then  people  that  are  technical  start  explaining  you  all,  well,  you  know,  it's  a  react,  it's  different  stack,  it's  this,  and  people  like  me  influence.  We  just  go  in  to  Lobo  and  like  build  me  a  Chrome  extension  based  on  this  app.  And  I  was  able  to  do  that  with  Lovable. There  were  people  that  were  able  to  build  desktop  applications,  unlovable,  again,  something  that  shouldn't  be  possible,  it  simply  is  right?  Our  community  manager  with  me  at  one  point,  she  was  like  building  this  presentation  deck  for  something.  She's  like,  would  it  be  cool  if  this  was  a  video,  right?  And  then  she  just  prompted  her  way  into  building  a,  generating  an  actual  video  inside  Lovable  before  that  was  available.  Now  that's  a  feature.  Now  you  can  prompt  lovable  to  do  it,  but  back  in  the  day  when  she  did  it,  even  I  thought  it  was  impossible,  I  never  tried  it.  So  I  think  that's  the  advantage  that  we  have  over  people  that  are  technical. We  just  come  into  this  completely  unbiased  and  very  positively  delusional,  which  I  think  you  have  to  have  when  working  with  AI  tools.  You  have  to  come  with  this  delusion  that  absolutely  everything  is  possible  until  proven  wrong  and  like  that's  just  the  pursuit  that  I  have  in  my  mind  that  has  helped  me.  Among  other  things  that  we'll  chat  today,  I  think,  to  excel  in  this  role  that  that  I  have  at  Lola. 
**Speaker 2**: Two  of  the,  I  think,  concerns  maybe  traps  people  that  don't  have  a  technical  background  fall  to  in  theory  is  one  is  if  you  get  blocked,  it's  not  obvious  how  to  solve  a  problem  and  2  is  just  are  you  building  like,  this  like  teetering  slop  that  will  collapse  someday  because  you  don't  know,  you  know,  system  architecture,  you  don't  know  if  this  is  going  to  scale  all  those  sorts  of  things?  So  coming  back  to  what  you've  learned  about  how  to  be  successful  and  build  successful  products,  talk  us  through  just  things  you've  done  and  things  you've  learned  for  how  to  avoid  those  sort  of  things  And  what  you  do  when  you  get  stuck  is  one  example. 
**Speaker 1**: I'm  happy  that  you  mentioned  like  those,  those  limitations.  I  have  some  other  ones  that  I  want  to  bring  in,  but  let's  address  this  one  first,  which  is  the  most  important  one,  and  that  is  you  have  to  be  self-sustaining,  right?  I  didn't  come  into  this,  Yes,  I  am  delusional,  as  I  mentioned,  in  the  sense  that  I  just  don't  want  to  accept  something.  It's  not  possible.  But  I'm  also  well  aware  that  I  need  to  be  better  in  order  for  it  to  become  reality  from  my  own  point  of  view,  in  my  own  sake. So  I  understood  very  early  that  coding  is  not  the  problem  that  we're  solving  for  here,  that  the  problem  we're  solving  for  is  clarity,  right?  Like  the  output  that  AI  can  do  is  much  faster  than  human  output  anyways.  So  like  very  early  on,  I  started  leveraging  chat  mode.  And  to  this  day,  I  can  say  I  spent  80%  of  my  time  in  planning  and  chatting  and  only  20%  in  executing  the  play,  actually,  right?  I'm  optimizing  for  the  right  kind  of  speed.  Most  people  optimize  for  the  wrong  one.  That's  the  first  lesson  that  I  learned  literally  on  day  2  because  I  just,  I  came  into  loveable.  That  was  my  first  exposure  to  this. I've  tested  and  played  around  with  all  the  tools,  obviously,  but  whether  somebody's  doing  it  a  cursor  or  cloud  code  doesn't  matter  where  you  are.  The  problem  remains  the  same. You  need  to  be  clear  on  what  you  want  to  do,  and  you  need  to  know  what  you're  doing  because  these  are  still  just  tools.  Yes  AGI  is  coming,  but  it's  not  there  yet.  So  like  until  it's  here,  you're  still  steering  the  ship  in  order  for  you  to  steer  the  ship,  you  kind  of  have  to  know  the  instructions,  right?  And  the  best  way  to  learn  is  by  building.  But  treating  these  tools  almost  as  technical  cosplayers  and  educators  and  learning  while  doing  and  religiously  reading  the  agent  output,  not  the  code  output.  I  don't  care  about  the  code,  like  the  syntax  is  none  of  my  interest.  It's  what  the  agent  tells  me,  then  that  matters  to  me. I  put  a  lot  of  trust  in  llds  and  AI  these  days,  and  I  understand  that  there  may  some  people  that  that  are  not  as  confident  as  I  am.  I  just  feel  that  the  models  today  are  good  enough  for  me  to  trust  in  their  syntax  output.  However  I'm  concerned  about  the  agent  output  and  because  of  the  tool  limitations  that  I  want  to  tackle. Tackle  along  next  right?  The  first  one  being  that  the  there  is  a  limitation  when  you  work  with  llds.  So  that's  there's  a  machine  level  limitation  and  there's  a  human  level  limitation,  right?  The  first  one  is  there's  something  that  that  is  known  as  the  context  memory  window,  right?  And  for  non-protected  the  people,  I  like  to  use  the  Aladdin  and  the  GD  analogy  when  I  explain,  right? It's  very  simple.  Everybody  knows  the  storyline.  You  rub  the  lamb,  a  genie  comes  out  and  tells  you,  okay  I'll  grant  you  three  wishes,  not  3000  wishes,  not  3 million,  just  3  at  a  time,  right? To  me,  when  I  translated  into  working  with  AI,  that  simply  means,  hey,  I  can  only  make  so  many  requests  within  a  request  at  a  time  for  AI  to  be  able  to  listen,  understand  what  needs  to  do,  scpi  it,  do  the  research,  read  like,  take  all  the  actions,  all  the  inputs  and  ingredients  that  it  needs  to  produce  a  high  quality  out,  right?  So  that's  the  first  part,  understanding  that  there's  a  limit  and  it's  denominated  in  tokens.  Maybe  that's  going  to  be  different  a  year  from  now.  But  today,  there's  a  token  limitation.  I'll  take  an  arbitrary  number  of  100000  tokens,  for  example.  So  when  you  make  a  request,  a  part  of  those  tokens  is  AI  spends  to  read  stuff,  another  two  brands  do  web,  another  to  think,  and  then  another  to  execute  the  code,  right? Then  there  comes  the  second  limitation,  which  is  you,  me,  and  you  humans,  which  is,  let's  go  back  to  the  analogy  of  the  genie  and  the  Aladdin.  I  asked  the  genie  for  the  first  wish.  And  the  first  wish  is  I  want  to  be  taller,  and  guess  what  happens?  Genie  makes  me  13  feet  tall  all  of  a  sudden,  I  can't  sit  in  the  car,  I  can't  get  into  my  house. I'm  a  dysfunctional  human  being,  right?  Right,  because  I  was  not  specific,  right?  Like  so  the  part  that  we  need  to  optimize  for  today,  it's  gon  na  get  better,  but  today  it's  still  not  there  yet. Is  that  AI  just  don't  understand,  what  do  you  mean  when  you  say,  you  know  what  I  mean,  like  you  do  when  I  tell  you  that  we  as  humans,  we  have  I'm  36,  so  I  have  36  years  of  experience  of  human  living  as  a  human  to  know  what  you  mean,  but  AI  doesn't  have  that,  right?  So  you  need  to  be  specific,  you  need  to  provide  references,  you  need  to  provide  the  right  context.  So  what  I've  learned  is  how  to  combat  that  part.  And  I  think,  you  know,  because  I  can't  control  the  first  part,  which  is  the  token  memory  window,  the  quality  of  the  llen  models,  you  are  100%  control  of  the  ladder.  And  that's  what  I  want  to  dive  into  today  as  well.  And  just  trying  to  teach  people,  okay,  if  I'm  the  malleable  part,  how  do  I,  how  do  I  fix  that  part,  right?  I  think  that's  the  key  lesson  here. 
**Speaker 2**: This  is  so  helpful,  and  I  love  this  metaphor  of  the  genie.  This  piece  of  that  clarity  is  such  a  thread  I've  been  noticing  across  people  that  have  been  successful  using  AI  tools,  and  it  feels  like  an  emerging  core  skill  is  learning  how  to  be  learning  clarity  in  the  ask  of  the  AI.  Do  you  have  any  advice  or  anything  you  do  there  to  help  be  better  at  being  clear  with  what  you  want? 
**Speaker 1**: Yeah,  so  first of all,  you  need  to  be,  as  you  said  yourself  right  now,  you  need  to  be  good  at  understanding  what  clarity  means  and  how  to  translate  it.  In  my  terms,  clarity  means  understanding  what  tasteful  looks  like,  what's  good  enough  versus  what's  world  class,  what's  magical.  And  I  developed  that  through  something  that  I  heard  from  you  mentioned  before,  which  is  exposure  time,  right?  Making  sure  that  I'm  exposing  myself  to  content  and  to  people  and  to  relationships  or  whatever  that  are  gon  na  help  me  to  level  up  in  that  domain. Again,  it  goes  back  to  self-sovereign  like  I  knew  when  even  before  I  joined,  blah,  blah,  I  was  like,  okay,  even  before  I  started  using  lomba  adii  tools,  first  thing  that  I  knew  was  like,  I  don't  know  how  to  code,  right?  Thing  was  like,  oh,  I  can  build,  wow,  amazing.  But  a  week  later  was  like,  oh,  I  can  build,  but  I'm  not  fast  enough,  So  I  optimized  for  speed.  So  I  was  like,  oh,  I  can  build,  and  I  can  build  so  fast.  And  then  two  weeks  later,  my  development  cycle  that  I'm  in  began,  and  it's  still  ongoing,  which  is,  wait  a  minute,  should  I  have  I  even  built  this  in  the  first  place?  Because  it's  like  at  once  you  figure  out  that  we  solved  for  the  how,  which  is  use  AI  assistant  or  rapid  engineering,  call  it  whatever  you  want.  You  can  call  it  vibe  coding  if  you  want  to,  but  we  solve  for  that.  Now  we  got  to  solve  for  everything  else,  and  everything  else  is  what  matters. Good  design,  good  taste,  good  user  or  experience.  Like  when  you  think  about  who  you're  building  stuff  for  with  these  tools,  you're  building  it  for  humans,  humans  are  emotional  beings,  and  we  all  make  our  purchasing  or  any  kind  of  decisions  on  an  emotional  basis,  right? So  I  think  that  the  core  skill  there  to  work  on  and  today  isn't  again,  coding,  although  I  have  nothing  against  traditional  engineering  and  I'll  say  later  why  I'm  actually  a  big  fan  of  it  of  elite  engineering,  but  people  like  me,  people  watching  that  are  like,  should  I  start  learning  how  to  code?  If  you  haven't  done  it  yet?  I'd  honestly  say  no,  like  you're,  you're  optimizing  for  the  wrong  skill  set.  We  won't  be  rewarded  in  the  world  of  AI  for  faster  raw  output,  we  will  be  rewarded  for  better  judgment. So  I  think  that  better  judgment  comes  with  again  to  go  back  to  your  question  like,  how  are  you  solving  for  that?  How  are  you  solving  for  this?  Well,  it  starts  with  exposure.  So  I'm  deliberately  exposing  myself  to  people  and  resources  that  I  need.  No,  I  need  to  consume  to  level  up,  and  then  a  lot  of  it  just  comes  from  building  as  well,  you  know,  if  we're  honest,  like  it's  a  muscle,  everything  is  a  muscle,  you  need  to  practice,  you  need  to  see  what's  possible.  And  you  know,  though,  that's  where  some  of  the  techniques  and  mindset  shifts  that  I  want  to  also  use  an  opportunity  today  to  ingrain  into  people's  minds,  layer  down  the  call  may  be  useful. 
**Speaker 2**: So,  okay,  so  what  I'm  hearing  here  is  because  coding  is  now  essentially  a  solve  problem,  I  love  that  you  don't  look  at  the  code.  You  don't  even  like  you've  you've  never  coded,  you  don't  want  to  look  at  the  code,  you  don't  care  about  what's  happening  there,  that  instead  you're  watching  this  agent  output.  I  want  to  actually  ask  about  that,  but  what  I'm  hearing  here  is  the  areas  you  are  investing  in  building  in  yourself  is  at  the  front  end  clarity  around  what  it  is.  And  I  want  to  hear  how  you  actually  do  that.  What  you  do  there,  you  have  a  really  cool  system  there.  And  then  there's  like  the  taste  and  judgment  of  knowing,  is  this  the  thing  I  want?  It  feels  like  those  are  the  two  sides  now  that  are  more  and  more  important  and  on  the  taste  judgment  side,  you  shared  this  concept  there,  something  guier  Ma  Rauch  shared  on  in  our  conversation,  this  idea  of  exposure  time,  exposure  hours,  being  exposed  to  great  stuff. Here's  a  great  user  experience,  here's  a  great  onboarding  club,  here's  a  great,  I  don't  know,  website.  So  I  really  like  that  advice  because  it's  so  it's  so  actionable.  Okay,  I  just  gonna  I'm  gonna  spend  more  time  with  stuff,  that's  great  to  inform  my  taste  and  judgment.  And  then  on  the  clarity  piece,  let's  actually  talk  about  that.  Just  what  do  you,  what  do  you  do  there  to  be  clearer  with  lovable  and  other  AI  tools  to  help  it  build  the  right  thing? 
**Speaker 1**: This  is  the  first  mindset  mindset  shift  that  I  want  to  put  into  people's  minds,  right?  If  you  just  have  a  vague  idea,  let  that  be  your  first  version  of  the  project.  Open  cursor,  lovable,  whatever  it  is  that  you're  using,  and  just  input  a  brain  dump  prompt,  right?  Just  talk  into  it.  Lovable.  Specifically,  I  don't  know  about  the  other  tools,  has  a  really  cool  voice  function.  You  click  it,  you  just  dictate  the  hell  of  it  and  just  press  send,  right?  Don't  even  wait  for  it  to  finish.  Open  a  new  window  again.  Lobo,  do  them  in  here. You're  like,  okay,  as  I  was  brain  dumping,  I  think  I  found  a  good  thread,  right?  I  think  things  are  getting  clearer,  so  let  me  start  another  project  now  with  more  clarity,  more  deliverability,  like  I  know  which  features  I  want,  which  pages  I  want,  maybe  I  can  even  find  a  good  reference.  Maybe  I  can  go  on  Marvin,  maybe  I  can  go  on  Dribble,  maybe  I  can  go  wherever,  get  a  good  screenshot,  get  a  good  animation  and  attach  it  because  most  of  these  tools  accept  files  as  a  part  of  the  input.  So  like  you  have  the  second  project  started  now,  things  are  even  more  clear  now  you  expose  yourself  to  quality,  and  now  you're  like,  well,  what  if  I,  what  if  I  found  a  template  that  actually  is  already  out  there?  Why  re-invent  in  the  wheel?  I'm  building  a  platform  that  somebody  else  built,  why  not  expose  AI  to  what  quality  looks  like,  right?  So  what  I'll  do  is  I'll  go  to  and  find  a  library  21st  then  or  or  that  build  or  like  whatever  places  which  allow  me  not  to  export  screenshots,  but  export  code  snippets  because  guess  what? Even  though  English  is  the  number  one  programming  language,  lovable  and  all  other  tools  still  communicate  in  code  the  best  If  you  want  to  get  pixel  perfect  results,  just  give  them  code.  It  will  interpret  it  better  than  your  English  or  Spanish  or  whatever  language  that  you  use  in  these  tools.  So  that's  the  third  way. You're  like,  okay,  now  even  more  deliberate.  I'm  not  I'm  not  even  going  as  as  why  this,  like  giving  it  vague  concepts?  I'm  giving  it  code  snippets,  like  I  want  this  exact  design,  I  want  this  exact  type  of  functionality.  So  that's  your  third  project.  Then  by  that  time  you  do  all  of  these  three,  you're  already  at  a  level  of  clarity  that  you  wouldn't  have  if  you  just  sat  with  an  empty  piece  of  paper  or  maybe,  maybe  chatting  just  with  ChatGPT,  but  not  taking  action.  I  think  taking  action  is  so,  so  cheap  these  days  and  free,  by  the  way,  like  all  the  tools  I  mentioned  have  free  plans,  like  most  times  you  would  be  able  to  do  this  without  spending  any  money  at  all  just  by  starting  multiple  projects,  because  guess  what?  That  doesn't  also  cost  anything  either  or  doesn't  incur  additional  costs  except  for  builder  credits. You're  going  to  get  3,  4,  5,  6  different  concepts  that  you  can  compare  as  you're  comparing  them.  Clarity  just  keeps  coming  like  and  things  get  better  and  better  to  understand.  And  you're  also  solving  for  one  big  problem  that  you  mentioned.  You  used  the  term  AI  slop.  And  I  like  it  because  a  lot  of  people,  when  they  say  AI  slop,  they  don't  refer  the  beautifying  the  code,  but  beautifying  the  design,  right?  This  process  that  I  just  mentioned  actually  gives  you  4  or  five  different  design  options  and  in  the  long  run,  save  you  massive  amounts  of  credits  because  a  lot  of  people  obsess  over  the  concept  of,  oh,  when  I  give  them  this. Hack,  they're  like,  oh,  but  that  doesn't  that  cost  more?  I'm  like,  yes,  upfront,  it  may  cost  a  little  bit  more  in  the  long  run.  If  you  really  want  to  finish  this  project,  you're  actually  saving  hundreds  of  credits  and  maybe  even  hundreds  of  dollars,  not  to  mention  the  amount  of  days,  simply  because  you  started  from  a  point  of  better  clarity  and  better  refinement  process,  right? That's  the  first  step  of  solving  for  clarity.  There  are  more,  right,  which  is  the  second  layer.  But  I  assume  you  may  have  some  questions  on  this  one  questions  and  also  just. 
**Speaker 2**: wow,  this  is  so  such  a  great,  it  shows  you  the  power  of  having  someone  come  into  this  world  without  an  engineering  background.  This  advice  of  just  build  it  five  times  in  parallel,  ask  A  to  try  all  kinds  of  stuff  like  this  is  not  how  someone  that  has  been  a  software  engineer  or  PM  or  designer  would  approach  though.  So  your  advice  here,  which  is  so  fun  is  as  you're  getting  started  with  a  project,  just  run  five  different  approaches  at  it  to  start.  One  is  just  brain  dump.  Here's  what  I'm  thinking.  Here's  a  general  idea,  like  you  use  whisper  flow  or  use  the  built  in  mic,  and  then  2  is,  okay,  now  I  have  a  general  idea,  let  me  try  to  type  it  out,  like  actually  thinking  through  the  prompt  3  is  let  me  find  a  mock  design  somewhere  online  and  the  sites  you  suggested  were  mobin  and  dribble,  those  are  the  two  that  you  go  to. 
**Speaker 1**: Yeah,  most  okay. 
**Speaker 2**: and  then  the  fourth,  these  are  all  in  parallel's  great  is  find  like  actual  code  template  that  looks  similar  to  the  thing  you  want  to  build  download  like  the  zip  file  basically  and  put  attach  it  or  is  it  just  HTML  and  CSS  is  that  kind  of  like  anything,  anything  you  got?  Yeah,  here,  yeah,  okay,  and  then  cool,  here's  the  prompt  here,  make  me  what  I  want  and  what  I  love  is  there's  two  wins  here,  1  is  just  it  helps  you  clarify  the  idea  as  you  see  the  tool  build  it  like,  oh,  no,  that's  not  what  I  mean,  let  me  try  it  again,  and  then  2  is  you're  it  out,  you  can  pick  the  right  direction  so  that  you're  not  locked  in  to  your  first  design  and  first  architecture  to  your  point  if  you  then  spend  all  this  time  trying  to  fine  tune  design  and  direction  it's  like  all  these  tokens  are  being  lost,  you  could  have  just  started  over  this  is  so  great,  someone  may  think  okay,  of  course  you're  just  getting  us  to  spend  all  these  lovable  tokens.  This  is  what  a  lovable  person,  but  tell  me,  but  what  I'm  feeling  is  this  is  where  you  could  save  the  most  money  because  if  you  get  a  correct  in  the  beginning,  you  save  so  much  work  trying  to  get  it  back  to  where  you  want  it  to  go . 
**Speaker 1**: a million  percent  that  I'm  actually  saving  people,  like  I'm  actually  going  against  what  I  should  be  saying  if  I  was  thinking  about  lovable.  I'll  be  like,  no,  no,  just  try  to  fix  it  in  perpetuity,  but  that's  not,  we're  not  in  business  of  doing  that.  We're  in  business  and  we  empowering  anybody  to  build  anything  that  they  want  and  then  you  know,  it's  my  personal  mission  that  resonates  with  me  because  if  if  there  wasn't  lovable,  I  would  have  never  built  anything  potentially  in  my  life.  And  I  don't  think  that  that  would  have  been  a  fun  life  to  live.  So,  you  know,  I  guarantee  people  like  I've  tested  this  framework  with  many  people  and  everybody  tell  me  the  same  thing. Eye  opener,  so  simple  yet  unintuitive,  as  you  said,  even  though  for  me,  it's  kind  of,  I  don't  know,  as  you  said,  I  attributed  to  non-technical  background. To  me,  that  was  the  first  thing  that  I  would  do,  like  I  just  did  it.  I  never  thought  about  it  like,  oh  I'm  developing  this  amazing  hack  each.  I  was  just  like  I'm  waiting  all  this  time  for  these  agents  to  finish,  I  might  as  well  start  another  project  and  another  one  and  another  one.  And  it's  also  a  productivity  hack  that  when  people  ask  me  like,  wow,  how  do  you  ship  so  many  things?  I'm  like,  I  never  built  just  one  project  at  a  time.  I  built  5  or  6,  I  have  six  lovable  tabs,  I  just  switch  between  them  and  that's  the  next  hack  that  I  want  to  talk  about  if  you  allow  me,  which  is  the  question  in  return  is  the  obvious  one,  which  is  how  do  you  context  switching?  Like  you  talk  about  context  so  much,  yet  you  keep  switching  between  apps,  how  do  you  manage  to  do  it  and  do  it  in  a  way  that's  productive,  produce  bad  code  or  bad  product?  That's  how  I  solve  for  that  llum  problem  again,  the  Aladdin  and  the  magic  lamp  and  all  that,  which  is,  if  there's  a  limited  token  window,  how  do  I  make  it  dynamic? And  what  do  I  mean  by  that  is  this,  if  you  just  go  and  you  prompt,  and  you  prompt  and  you  prompt  and  you  prompt,  you  realize  it  no  matter  what  tool  you  use,  the  memory  just  isn't  infinite,  right?  By  the  time  you  reach  message  number  1015,  2030,  40,  snippets  of  early  messages  sort  of  get  lost  in  the  translation  because  agent  is  optimizing  for  speed,  right?  If  it  had  to  read  the  entire  conversation  and  the  entire  stream  of  requests  that  you  made,  developing  anything  viable  or  large  would  be  impossible  because  it's  just  like  consuming  a  lot  of  time  and  a  lot  of  memory  and  a  lot  of  tokens. So  again,  something  that  I  just  figured  out  very  early  on  as  I  was  building  was  like,  okay,  if  it  can't  remember  things,  my  job  is  to  provide  it  with  reference.  So  let  me  treat  lovable  or  any  other  tool  as  an  engineer  that  I'm  supposed  to  be  providing  perpetual  context  as  the  project  goes  and  you  can  do  that  in  many  ways.  But  the  most  efficient  way  that  I  found  was  like,  I  would  do  the  four  parallel  builds,  like  let's  continue  off  of  that  example  very  quickly  after  you've  built  hundreds  of  projects  like  I  did,  like  you  see  the  winner,  like  the  winner  is  so  obvious,  it's  not  even  a  competition,  you  maybe  do  one  or  more  two  prompts  to  calibrate  it.  And  when  you're  like,  okay,  the  winner  is  here.  At  that  point,  I  either  ask  the  tool  that  I'm  using  or  I'll  maybe  let's  say  go  to  ChatGPT  or  whatever  and  ask  the  llum  to  produce  a  series  of  prds  what  prds  are  for  again,  people  that  are  not  familiar  with  the  terms  or  project  requirements  documents  or  for  me,  I  call  them  like  sources  of  truth,  right? What,  what  needs  to  be  true  for  this  project  to  be  successful?  From  a  couple  of  perspectives?  I  usually  build  something  that  I  call  a  master  plan.  It's  basically  a  compass  saying  here's  what  we're  building,  right?  It's  like  talking  to  a  human,  I  really  treat  love  about  like  a  human  being.  So  it's  like  this  is  what  we're  building.  Then  I  build  an  implementation  plan,  which  is  this  is  how  we  are  going  to  build  it  in.  This  is  the  sequence,  right?  It's  very  important  to  me. Again,  going  back  to  quality,  taste,  human  nature,  I  need  to  define  because  I'm  still  working  with  a  system  that  is  not  emotionally  intelligent  yet.  I  need  to  define  how  I  want  the  app  to  look  and  feel.  So  another  PRD  that  I  build  is  design  guidelines.  And  then  finally,  something  that  just  circles  it  all  around,  which  is  like,  okay,  when  we  know  how  things  look  and  when  we  know  how  we're  building  it,  how  does  the  user  journey  look  like,  right?  A  user  registers  and  then  what?  And  then  when  they  register  and  do  that  first  step,  what's  the  second  step  and  what's  the  third  step  and  whatnot?  So  I  built  at  least  four  prds,  right?  And  then  when  these  are  built,  I  read  them. That's  the  planning  chatting  part,  like  that's  where  I'll  spend  a  lot  of  time  now  on  when  I  nail  down  that  first  design.  I'll  spend  an  entire  day  if  I  need  to  just  planning  this  part  out,  like  documentation  and  breaking  things  down  because  that's  how  I'm  setting  the  course.  Like  everything's  going  to  be  dependent  on  this  particular  part  of  the  process.  When  I'm  done  doing  that,  I  build  one  final  document,  which  I  call  either  plan,  do  MD  or  tasks,  do  MD  and  dot  MD  part  is,  you  know,  marked  down.  Basically  I'm  just  using  Markdown  format  because  I've  learned  that  AI  likes  to  read  Markdown  and  what  that  serves  as  a  serves  as  a  source  of  truth  on  actual  task's  and  subtasks  that  it  will  need  to  execute  to  get  to  the  finish  line,  right?  And  then  there's  the  final,  final  layer,  which  is,  depending  on  what  tool  you  use  Cloud  code  or  cursor  have  what's  known  as  rules  domdidier  domdidier  arere,  basically  doing  with  rules  or  agent  files.  You're  letting  the  agent  know  how  you  want  it  to  behave  and  what  you  should  focus  on  in  the  long  run  so  that  you  don't  have  to  repeat  yourself  with  every  prompt,  right?  So  in  lovable,  there's  theres  a  separate  menu  for  that  in  your  project  settings  where  you  can  define  project  knowledge. And  usually  when  I'll  say,  hey,  read  all  the  files  before  you  do  anything,  like  don't  do  anything  before  you  read  all  the  prds  read  tasks,  do  MD  to  see  which  task  is  next,  then  execute  on  that  next  next  set  of  tasks.  And  when  you're  done,  tell  me  what  you  did  and  how  it  should  test  it.  And  that's  where  that  conversation  about  I  religiously  read  the  age  of  output  comes  into  play. I've  told  the  I  gave  the  agent  everything,  all  the  tools  and  resources  that  it  needs  to  succeed.  I  gave  it  the  rules,  I  gave  it  the  docs,  I  told  it  what  to  do  with  them.  And  at  that  point  I'm  just  sitting  and  reading  or  I  don't  prompt  anymore.  From  that  point  on,  I  can  switch  as  many  windows  as  I  like.  My  prompts  have  become  proceed  with  the  next  next  task.  I  don't  need  the  context.  I  outsource  that  and  delegate  the  that  to  the  agent. The  agent  needs  context  and  I  need  to  make  sure  that  it's  dynamic.  I  need  to  make  sure  that  I'm  regularly  updating  the  documents  from  time  to  time  so  that  we  shift  that  token  window  it  it  uses  and  how  it  uses  it  over  time.  But  I'm  not  prompting.  I'm  not  interrupting  the  flow.  Yes  I'll  go  in  test,  maybe  put  a  prompt  in  here  or  there,  but  that's  how  I  can  build  five  projects  simultaneously  and  never  lose  the  productivity  part,  which  is,  again,  as  I  said,  I  do  this  today  manually. Call  me  to  talk.  Three  months  from  now.  An  agent  will  do  this  for  me.  I'll  be  out  of  job  pretty  much.  That's  why  I  don't  optimize  for  this  skill  at  all,  like  I'm  using  it  today  to  bypass  the  shortcomings  of  human  nature  and  llds,  but  I'm  optimizing  100%  of  my  time  today  on  good  judgment,  clar  quality,  taste,  good  copy,  good  fonts.  Like  people  don't  talk  about  fonts  at  all  that  work  with  AI.  They're  like  60%  in  my  mind,  maybe  even  more  in  how  your  output  is  going  to  look  like.  That's  my  obsession,  like  I  don't  obsess  over  these  things  that  I'm  talking  today  because  I  know  what's  coming  like. The  agents  are  going  to  get  better.  The  models  are  going  get  better.  They're  not  going  to  need  me  to  extend  the  context.  They're  going  to  do  it  themselves.  So  for  me,  the  skill  that  I  optimize  for  is,  is  the  one  that  that  like  requires  better  decision  making  rather  than  better  output  or  better  alignment. 
**Speaker 2**: Oh  my  God,  there's  so  much  here.  This  is  so  awesome.  Okay,  so  essentially  what  what's  happening  here  is  you  start  a  project,  try  a  bunch  of  stuff,  pick  a  direction  that  feels  most  correct,  and  once  you  have  a  set  direction,  you  spend  essentially  a  day  not  building,  but  working  with  this  AI  agent  to  plan.  And  then,  and  while  I  want  to  talk  about  that,  and  once  you  have  the  plan,  then  it's,  and  it's  amazing  that  you  could  do  stuff  like  this  with  what  people  some  people  may  feel  are  not  and  sophisticated  tools  that  can  build  incredibly  powerful  things  like  you  can  do  a  lot  of  this  with  tools  like  lovable,  like  have  plans  and  rules  and  MD  files  like,  you  know,  a  lot  of  people  may  not  think,  may  not  know  that.  And  so  the  idea  is,  okay,  spend  all  this  time  planning  because  again,  that'll  save  you  a  lot  of  time  down  the  road  and  then  only  once  you  have  a  plan  you  have  you  get  it  going  and  a  key  part  of  this  the  this  three  wishes  rule  is  really  important  the  reason  you're  doing  this  in  large  part  beyond  just  being  really  clear  about  the  plan  is  this  idea  of  1  task  at  a  time  keeps  the  agent's  context  window  small  so  that  it  doesn't  lose  track  of  where  it's  at  that  part  seems  important,  right?  It's  like,  do  this  thing  and  then  okay,  cool  now  do  the  next  thing. 
**Speaker 1**: right?  It  is  yes,  because  again,  if  let's  say  you  didn't  do  this,  let's  hy,  let's  talk  about,  you  know,  in  this,  you  know,  I  just  want  to  vibe  my  way.  Okay,  great,  no  problem. You  work,  you  work,  you  work  at  one  point,  something  breaks,  right?  You  haven't  documented  anything,  there's  not,  there's  no  reference  points,  you  report  a  problem,  you're  not  referencing  files  or  architecture  at  all,  you're  just  describing  the  issue.  Here's  what's  going  to  happen.  Any  tool,  loadable  or  cursor  or  plot,  whatever  tool  you  talk  about  is  going  to  do  this.  It's  going  to  be  like,  okay,  let  me  start  investigating,  and  then  your  code  base  gets  bigger  and  bigger  and  bigger  and  bigger  and  bigger,  like  when  you,  when  you  first  start,  you  have  like  20  files,  it's  can  read  20  files,  but  what  what  happens  when  you  have  I'm  just  building  a  project  right  now  that  has  like  60,  70  edge  function  functions,  right?  What  happens  then  when  I  say  this  broke  and  there's  no  reference,  which  edge  function  does  what,  guess  what  level  is  going  to  read  all  of  those  and  it's  going  to  consume  80%  of  the  token  allocation  on  reading  to  get  clarity,  leaving  only  the  final  20%  for  thinking  and  executing  what  I'm  guessing.  And  I  can't  prove  this,  an  lolly  expert  in  the  comments  may  say  that  I'm  wrong,  but  this  is  my  best  guess. As  a  non  educated  person,  these  tools  are  very  obedient  and  very  agreeable,  they're  going  to  lie  to  you,  they're  going  to  tell  you  that  they  fix  the  problem  even  though  they  didn't.  They're  just  going  to  try  to  make  you  feel  happy  and  say,  yes,  I  found  what  the  problem  is  and  I  fixed  it.  A  lot  of  times  when  they  don't,  people  blame  the  machine  and  to  an  extent  I  will  say  that's  true,  it's  your  fault  my  friend,  you  did  not  provide  any  clearer  context  to  this  tool.  You  just  used  its  raw  power  and  dug  a  deeper  hole  with  your  spinning  your  wheels  into  the  into  the  mud,  right?  And  you  know,  obviously  I  think  we're  heading  into  a  world  where  AI  is  more  honest  than  obedient  and  saying,  hey,  I  only  partially  fix  this,  you  know,  you  did  not  give  me  enough  of  a  context,  right?  The  bigger  mistake  that  people  make  then  is  like  they  trust  the  tool,  fixed  it,  they  test,  they  see  it  didn't,  then  they  get  mad  at  start  cursing  and  yelling,  as  we  say,  and  then  it  gets  even  worse  because  guess  what? Another  bad  trait  of  AI  is  du,  it's  best  not  to  hurt  your  feelings  and  never  say  you're  the  dumb  one.  It  says  no  I'm  the  dumb  one.  So  it  focuses  in  the  next  request.  Instead  of  focusing  on  reading,  it  spends  another  30%  of  tokens  trying  to  come  up  with  an  apology,  right?  Again  I'm  not  educated,  but  if  you  ever  read  like  a  stream  of  ChatGPT's  thinking  in  thinking  models,  you  see  exactly  what  I  mean.  Like  when  I  insulted,  I  see  that  the  first  message  is  okay,  the  user  is  mad.  So  I  need  to  think  of  ways  how  to  reduce  their  anxiety  or  whatever. I'm  like,  oh  man,  I  just  fell  for  the  worst  drinkin  of  the  book.  I  made  it  spend  the  most  scarce  resource,  which  is  those  tokens  on  thinking  how  it  should  address  my  anxiety  versus  focusing  on  the  actual  problem.  So  my  advice  for  people  is  like,  yes,  vibe  your  way  for  fun  and  vibe  your  way  while  you're  prototyping,  because  that's  the  exploration  part.  I  love  that  part.  But  when  exploration  is  done,  please,  please,  please  use  referencing  documentation. Use  all  the  agent  files  that  you  can  because  the  that  that  token  allocation  is  so  scarce,  like  it's  going  to  get  expanded  over  time,  things  are  going  to  get  cheaper  faster.  But  right  now  it's  still  so  valuable  and  precious.  You  really  need  to  make  sure  that  they  are  allocated  in  the  right  direction . 
**Speaker 2**: because  this  is  hilarious.  I  think  the  genie  metaphor  is  so  good  here.  Just  thinking  about  this  genie  is  you're  trying  to  be  clear  about  what  it  is  you  want  And  if  you're  just  like  vibe,  you  know,  vibe,  wishing  it'll  do  the  wrong  thing.  So  the  advice  here  is  be  as  give  it  as  much  context  about  what  you  want  it  to  do  as  possible.  And  these  files  we'll  talk  about  right  after  this. The  idea  here  is  just  like  laser  show  the  point,  the  laser  at  where  you  want  it  to  fix  the  problem.  Don't  just  assume  it'll  go  figure  out  because  it  will  and  it'll  try  really  hard  to  and  it'll  waste  all  your  tokens.  It'll  fill  the  context  window.  And  I  remember  at  one  point  you  mentioned  before  this  recording  that  because  it  starts  to  run  out  of  space  in  the  in  the  context  window,  it  start  it  just  like  the  solution  ends  up,  it  doesn't  actually  work  that  hard  on  figuring  it  out  in  the  end  because  it  spent  all  this  energy  on  reading  and  thinking.  And  then  it's  like,  okay,  here  at  the  last  second,  here's  a  solution . 
**Speaker 1**: picks  the  first  thing,  and  he  thinks  it's  broken  that  just  again,  this  is  me  completely  uneducated  coming  in  into  the  conversation  and  just  thinking  out  loud,  that's  just  my  gut  feeling  in  the  way  I  think  logically  about  it,  which  is,  hey,  if  it  consumes  most  of  its  window  and  knows  that  it's  running  out  of  it,  maybe  it's  aware  that  it's  running  out,  maybe  it  isn't.  But  either  way,  I  had  the  experience  anecdotally  to  where  like  my  request  is  unclear,  I  feel  it  takes  the  easiest  fix  in  the  book,  just  the  easiest  versus  the  other  way  around  where  I'm  like  spending  so  much  time  finding  the  right  file,  referencing  that  file,  like  really  putting  in  the  effort  of  hand,  holding  it  in  dark,  maybe  giving  it  a  flashlight,  and  then  saying,  here's  the  problem.  I  think  that  this  is  the  problematic  file.  And  then  it's  like,  oh,  yeah,  you're  right,  and  now  I'm  gon  na  actually  fix  over  and  over  and  over.  And  I've  seen  that  because  again,  all  I  do  is  read  the  output,  makes  me  learn  how  to  use  it  by  some  people  read,  I  don't  know  what  people  read,  but  all  I  read  is  the  output,  like  I  don't  read  the  code  and  it's  later  down  the  road  because  like  I  know  that  it  can  do  that  much  better  than  I  can.  Again,  I  feel  if  there's  a  good  quote  I've  read,  I  can't,  I  apologize  to  the  author  because  I  can't  attribute  it  off  the  top  of  my  head,  but  it's  like  the  ceiling  on  the  AI  isn't  the  model  intelligence,  it's  what  the  model  sees  before  it  acts,  right?  So  that's  the  ceiling  right  now. Like  what,  what  are  you  exposing?  We  talk  about  exposure  time  for  humans.  What  are  you  exposing  your  agent  to  as  well  is  as  important,  if  not  even  more  important  before  it  makes  code  edits. 
**Speaker 2**: Coming  back  to  these  files,  I  think  this  is  really  important.  So  let's  think  about  just  like  what's  like  the  MVP  for  someone  that  wants  to  do  this  better?  You  listed  all  these  kind  of  files,  these  MD  files  essentially,  that  you're  building  over  the  course  of  a  day  before  you  start  actually  building  the  thing,  you  had  design  guidelines,  the  user  journey  tasks,  agents,  MD  rules.  MD  say  you  wanted  to  just  like  move  one  step  forward  and  be  better  at  the  stuff.  What  are  what  are  the  files  you'd  create  And  then  what  do  they  roughly  look  like? 
**Speaker 1**: What's  inside  these  files?  Yeah,  so  the  master  plan  is  the  first  one,  which  is  like  it's  a  10000 ft  overview,  right?  It  really  high  level  explains  the  intent,  that  I  have  with  the  appapillai  plan. 
**Speaker 2**: that  MD,  is  that  what  you  call  it? 
**Speaker 1**: Yes,  yeah,  master  plan,  that  MD,  and  it's  like,  it's  really  just  like,  hey,  this  is  why  I'm  doing  this.  This  is  who  I'm  doing  it  for.  This  is  how  I  want  them  to  you  feel.  And  a  lot  of  times  in  the  master  plan,  I  will  reference  the  other  prds  I'll  be  like  the  design  needs  to  feel  modern  and  slick,  but  for  exact,  you  know,  parameters,  consult  and  read  design  guidelines  do  MD,  right? So  I'm  using  just  the  master  plan  as  like  this  high  level  overview,  right  to  get  the  agent  into,  oh,  okay,  yeah,  we  are  building  XYZ,  right?  Then  there's  the  implementation  plan  because  you  know,  there  needs  to  be  some  order  if  you  just  like  dump  stuff  on  top  of  each  other  without  any  order,  you're  never  going  to  get  to  the  finish  line.  And  this  is  tasks  that  MD,  is  that  what  you  call  it?  So  that  that's  the  implementation  plan?  Implementation  plan,  yeah,  an  implementation  plan  is  kind  of  in  service  of  the  future  tasks  that  MD  if  that  all  of  these  files  are  in  service  of  building  tasks  DoD,  when  you  build  tasks  that  MD,  then  the  rest  is  almost  irrelevant.  It's  just  the  basis  for  you  to  build  tasks  to  execute  you,  right? The  implementation  plan  is  kind  of  the  first  layer,  which  is  again,  higher  level  overview.  It  doesn't  go  into  the  depth  of  like  how  to  get  there,  it  just  goes  into  the  explaining  of  like,  oh,  well,  if  we're  building  this,  I  think  we  should  start  with  the  backend  and  we  should  start  with  cables  and  then  later  authentication.  And  then  after  that,  we're  going  to  bring  in  the  API.  And  then  after  that,  we're  going  to  do  this  is  it  again,  just  think  of  it  as  savvy. I'm  an  ideas  guy.  I'm  sitting  with  a  technical  guide,  me  and  you,  we're  building  our  startup,  I  know  you're  a  software  engineer  by  background  and  I'm  telling  you  my  idea.  I'm  giving  you  the  master  plan,  and  you  come  to  me  back  and  you're  like,  okay.  If  you  want  to  do  this,  it's  doable.  Here's  how  I  would  order  it.  Like,  you're  going  to  have  a  roadmap,  you're  not,  you  can't  open  your  linear  and  started  writing  features  and  Rfcs  and  whatever,  you're  just  high  level  talking  about  the  order  of  things. And  then  me  and  you,  again,  as  two  cosplayers,  we  talk  and  say,  okay,  well,  if  we  agree  on  this,  like  how,  how  should  this  look  like?  How  should  this  feel?  Let's  describe  it  high  level.  But  now  because  I  use  AI,  I  can  go  a  little  bit  deeper  and  that's  where  I  like  to  see  lovable  or  any  other  tool,  ChatGPT  is  good  at  it.  I  even  have  my  I've  like  custom  GPT,  So  if  people  want  to  start  somewhere  before  they  even  get  into  any  tool,  they  can  go  to  ChatGPT  store  and  for  GPT's  and  just  type  lovable  base  prompt  generator  or  lovable  the  generator  and  find  those  that  I  built  and  just  like  brain  dumping  them  and  then  get  these  files  as  output,  right?  So  I  like  to  see  some  elements  of  CSS  in  design  guidelines  because,  you  know,  with  design  is  a  little  bit,  it's  a  little  bit  tricky. AI  is  sometimes  over  creative.  So  that's  where  I'm  doing  a  little  bit  more  technical  steering,  right?  And  then  finally,  it's  just  the  user  journeys,  just  like  if  we  know  how  things  look  like,  if  we  know  how  they  feel,  if  we  know  what  we're  building  high  level,  like  high  level,  just  very  high  level,  again,  how  do  people  navigate?  What  are  some  of  the  features  in  there,  you  know,  and  stuff  like  that?  And  then  tasks  that  gets  into  the  nitty  radio,  like,  oh,  if  you  want  these  user  journeys  and  you  want  the  backend  built  first,  here's  a  set  of  tasks  that  I  need  to  do  like  it  just  takes  that  as  an  input.  I'm  just  making  the  tool  do  that  gritty  work  that  humans  used  to  spend  so  much  time.  I  feel  like  with  with  these  tools,  we're  all  becoming  product  managers  on  steroids,  you  know,  like  we're  just  leveraging  AI,  but  like  good  product  managers,  I  think  are  not  compensated  for  writing  good  prds  they're  compensated  again  for  good  judgment,  right?  Somebody  else  can  do  the  writing. You,  as  somebody  who  directs  and  builds  this  product,  you  need  to  know  again,  what,  what,  what's  going  to  be  useful  for?  What's  going  to  be  tasteful?  What's  going  to  be  something  that  actually  moves  the  needle?  I  will  say  one  thing,  though,  just  because  I  put  so  much  emphasis  on  like,  oh,  you  need  to  acquire  taste.  Oh,  you,  That  doesn't  mean  you  shouldn't  build.  You  get  better  at  this  by  building,  actually.  So  everybody  listening  to  this  should  like  literally  go  and  build  something  today.  One,  2,  3,  4,  5  projects,  tests,  all  of  these  tools  because  that's  how  you  get  to  clarity,  not  just  by  reading,  but  also  by  doing  as  well. 
**Speaker 2**: Here's  a  puzzle  for  you,  what  do  OpenAI  cursor  perplexity,  vercel  plat  and  hundreds  of  other  winning  companies  have  in  common?  The  answers,  they're  all  powered  by  today's  sponsor  Work  OS.  If  you're  building  software  for  enterprises,  you've  probably  felt  the  pain  of  integrating  single  sign-on,  skim  RBAC,  audit  logs,  and  other  features  required  by  big  customers.  Work  at  West  turns  those  deal  blockers  into  drop  in  Apis  with  a  modern  developer  platform  built  specifically  for  B2B  SaaS.  Whether  you're  a  see  stage  startup  trying  to  land  your  first  enterprise  customer  or  a  unicorn  expanding  globally  where  OS  is  the  fastest  path  to  becoming  enterprise  ready  and  unlocking  growth,  they're  essentially  stripe  for  enterprise  features.  Visit  oros  dot  com  to  get  started  or  just  hit  up  their  Slack  support  where  they  have  real  engineers  in  there  who  answer  your  questions.  Super  fast  weos  allows  you  to  build  like  the  best  with  delightful  Apis,  comprehensive  docs,  and  a  smooth  developer  experience.  Go  to  work  OS  dot  com  to  make  your  app  Enterprise  ready  Today. I  am  imagining  people  hearing  this  start  to  feel  like  this  is  so  much  work,  I  just  have  to  sit  here  and  create  all  these  rules  and  figure  out  all  these  little  details.  Like  in  one  sense  it  is.  In  another  sense,  this  is  like  you  spend  a  few  hours,  maybe  a  day  planning,  and  then  you  have  AI  build  this  thing  that  would  have  taken  somebody  weeks,  months,  right?  Like  the  amount  of  investment  to  achieve  this  thing  is  absurd  ROI.  It  also  this  shows  you  just  what  professional  vibe  coding  looks  like.  You  know,  everyone  imagines  Vibe  Co. I'm  just  sitting  here  type  of  stuff.  Go  and  do  this  if  you  want  to  actually  build  something  really  great  that  moves  the  needle,  as  you  said,  that  solves  people's  ears  problems,  that  lasts,  that,  you  know,  scales.  This  is,  this  is  how  you  do  it  if  you  really  want  to  do  this  as  a,  as  a  real,  as  a  job,  and  also  if  you  want  to  build  things  that  are  really  great. 
**Speaker 1**: Yeah,  and  don't  get  me  wrong,  like  there's,  there's  obviously  a  ton  of  value  in  prototyping,  like  there  are  a  lot  of  people  maybe  watching  this  that  are  like,  okay,  I  want  to  use  lovable  at  work,  but  I  can't  or  whatever,  you  know,  there,  there's  different  reasons.  There's  maybe  you're  in  healthcare  or  finance  or  there's  something  regulatory  that  just  prevents  you  from  pushing  to  production.  Building  for  the  sake  of  prototyping  is  one  of  the  best  use  cases. We  our  motto  for  2025  was  demo  don't  know  which  is  like  instead  of  writing  all  these  documents  and  talking  and  sitting  on  meetings  with  your  engineers,  trying  to  get  your  vision  as  a  marketer  or  a  sales  guy  in  the  office  across,  go  into  lovable  and  build  the  prototype  in  30  minutes  and  just  hand  it  over  like,  and  I  have  a  real  like  job  that  I  held  before,  lovable.  That's  exactly  what  happened.  Like  this  time  last  year.  I  needed  something  built  enterprise  grade  really  and  lovable,  and  myself  were  not  there  yet  to  build  it  at  that  point.  But  I  have,  I  had  a  team  of  engineers  that  I  worked  with.  I  built  the  prototype  in  four  hours  and  they  actually  were  able  to  replicate  it  6  to  seven  months  later  into  production  with  with  connecting  all  the  pipes  and  everything.  But  like  if  I  had  to  describe  it,  I  would  say  took  me,  it  would  take  me  at  least  a  week  or  two  just  to  get  the  words  out  there.  I  just  sat  and  built  it  in  four  hours. And  that's  like  lovable  January  last  year,  this  lovable  today  January 2026  is  like  ages,  ages  ahead  with  functionality  like  it's  so  much  better,  it's  not  even  a  contest,  right?  So  I  think  now  with  our  stage  where  like,  for  instance,  there's  I'd  say  at  least  to  best  of  my  knowledge,  at  least  half  of  SP  500  companies  have  people  working  in  them  that  are  using  lovable  to  some  extent,  right? And  we  have  a  lot  of  enterprise  companies  that  are  actually  on  enterprise  plans  with  lovable  that  are  creating  super  meaningful  projects.  Like  I'm  not  going  to  name  names,  but  like  leading  ride  share  companies  of  the  world,  leading  telecommunications  companies  of  the  world,  leading  leading  companies  of  the  world  in  many,  many  aspects. Healthcare,  finance,  like  are  actively  with  their  teams  using  lovable?  And  it's  always  the  same  feedback,  which  is,  yes,  we  may  not  be  able  to  push  to  pro,  but  like  our  marketers  are  no  longer  waiting  for  engineers.  Our,  you  know,  people  in  go  to  market  or  or  sales  or  HR  or  whatever  roles  are  now  just  confidently  building  internal  stuff  for  us  to  manage  our  expenses  or  manage  employee  onboarding  or  like  there's  so  many  use  cases  like  that  where  like  you're  seeing  lovable  and  other  tools  for  that  matter  being  used  to  push  things  into  production . 
**Speaker 2**: to  help  people  do  this  workflow  that  you're  describing  with  all  these  MD  files.  Do  you  think  you  could  share  after  we  record  this  just  templates  like  simple  templates  of  what  these  files  look  like  for  people  just  to  look  at  and  copy . 
**Speaker 1**: I  would  literally  go  to  ChatGPT  as  I  said  and  brain  dump  into  it  in  my  just  type  lovable  GPT,  lovable  PRD  generator.  You'll  see  my  name  there,  right?  And  that  I'm  the  author  go  in  brain  dump.  It  will  ask  you  a  couple  of  questions  to  get  clarity  and  just  produce  four  files  for  you  and  you  can  just  go  ahead  and  upload  those  amazing  cool. 
**Speaker 2**: we'll  link  to  that.  So,  so  it's  not,  it's  not  just  here's  a  bunch  of  files.  Let's  go  talk  to  this  thing.  It'll  generate  the  right  files  for  you.  And  then  you  plug  that  into  loveable  or  other  tools. 
**Speaker 1**: Yeah,  it's  trained  on,  it's  trained  to  think  like  I  do,  so  yeah. 
**Speaker 2**: Oh,  amazing.  Okay,  that  is  perfect.  By  the  way,  I  want  to  talk  about  like  how  you  unblock  yourself  because  there's  a  whole  other  series  of  tips.  So  you  have  there,  but  I  just  want  to  reflect,  it's  so  interesting  how,  one,  you're  kind  of  from  first  principles  under  learning  how  to  build  product  as  a  PM,  as  an  engineer,  as  a  designer,  and  you're  kind  of  figuring  out  a  workflow  where  AI  is  helping  fill  in  all  the  gaps  that  you  don't  have  for  as  an  engineer,  as  a  PM,  helping  you  craft  prds  and  design.  So  I  think  that's  so  interesting  just  this,  it's  interesting  that  these  functions  still  work  and  are  necessary  now  it's  and  AI  help  create  all  basically  this  triad  that's  always  existed  product  manager  engineering  and  design  and  something  I've  always  thought  is  that  there's  this  question  of  which  background  will  be  most  valuable  in  this  future?  Is  it  a  PM,  is  it  an  engineer,  is  it  a  designer?  My  mind  has  always  been  the  PM  function  is  like  their  job  is  clarify,  figure  out  what  to  build,  clarify  what  to  build,  be  really  clear  about  the  requirements,  figure  out  what  success  looks  like,  it  feels  like,  that's  where  the  skill  is  most  needed,  there's  also  a  design  component  of  like  make  this  look  awesome  and  it  feels  like  that's  going  to  be  an  emerging,  that  the  value  of  that  being  really  good  at  design  and  taste  and  judgment  is  only  going  to  go  up  before  we  get  to  things  you've  learned  about  it. Unblock  yourself  because  a  lot  of  times,  you  know,  things  don't  go  in  the  right  direction.  There's  a  bug  without  being  engineer.  What  do  you  do  before  we  get  there?  Is  there  anything  else  you  wanted  to  share  around. 
**Speaker 1**: just  like  tips  for  being  successful?  If  we  measure  success  in  the  right  terms  again,  AI,  as  you  pointed  out,  regardless  of  your  background  is  an  amplifier.  So  you  know,  if  if  you  don't  know  what  you're  doing,  you're  just  going  to  produce  garbage  faster. One  thing,  again,  I  just  want  to  double  down  on  is  in  the  old  world,  good  enough?  Was  good  enough,  right?  Because  even  producing  good  enough  was  not  easy,  right?  10  years,  15  years  ago,  just  producing  was  more  than  plenty  more  than  good  enough.  You  built  a  SaaS,  who  cares  how  it  looks  like  it  works?  It  does  stuff  the  idea,  oh  my  God.  I'm  so  much  more  productive  today. Like  if  good  enough  was  here,  let's  say  like  let's  visualize  it  for  people.  Like  if  this  was  like  pretty,  pretty  bad,  could  be  better,  mediocre,  good  enough  world  class,  If  this  was  the  gap  between  good  enough  and  world  class,  well  guess  what?  The  gap  is  now  this  because  everybody  produces  good  enough  with  AI.  Absolutely  everyone  does  it.  So  now  learning  and  optimize  it  for  how  do  I  produce  world  class  and  magic  is. The  key  lesson  to  take  away  today,  as  you  pointed  out,  I  think  Pms  are  the  winners  of  AI  today  because  they  bring  clarity.  If  I  was  a  betting  man,  as  they  say  I'd  bet  that  the  next  class  that  wins  our  designers,  we're  training  these  tools  to  be  more  clear,  to  be  better,  to  make  better  technical  decisions.  I  don't  think  we  will  train  them  just  yet  to  make  better  emotional  decisions.  And  I  think  design  is  all  about  emotion.  And  that's  where  like  the  level  of  the  skill  up  needs  to  come.  That's  the  biggest  level  up. If  you  ask  me  like,  oh,  what  is  the  main  thing  you  figure  out  when  you  join,  like  what's  the  biggest  personal  upskill?  Let's  say  like  working  with  Felix  Nad  Abby?  All  of  the  people  that  are  designers  just  really  what  moved  and  shifted  the  needle  for  me.  And  like,  oh,  so  this  is,  oh,  world  class  looks  like  this  is  what  it  takes,  right? I,  you  always  use  the  analogy  of  like,  I  wanted  to  steal  one  of  their  designs  and  bring  it  into  my  lovable  project.  So  I  went  into  Figma  and  I  was  like,  let  me  just  take  this  background.  I  can  just  put  it  in  there.  I  went  in  and  realize  that  what  could  be,  you  know,  interpreted  as  a  pretty  simple  or  rather  simple  gradient,  took  50  different  layers  to  produce.  So  I  clicked  on  that  component.  I  was  like,  oh  my  God,  this  is  not  three  colors.  This  is  50  colors.  And  not  just  50  colors,  50  colors  with  different  gradients  of  levels  of  opacity.  So  I  was  like,  oh,  okay,  well  that,  and  that's  the  big  connect  oft  that  I've  had  all  along. So  like,  again,  if  you,  if  I'm  answering  your  question  directly  of  like,  okay,  what  are  some  of  the  other  tricks?  What  are  some  of  the  other  things? Design  guys?  Just  expose  yourself  to  exquisite  designs.  Follow  Felix  from  From  Lovable.  He  has  an  amazing  newsletter,  like  to  teach  you  how  to  and  learn  how  to  prompt  for  good  design.  Learn  about  design  styles.  I  didn't  know  what  Bauhaus  meant  or  glass  morphism  had  no  idea,  so  I  built  an  app  as  well  for  that  and  lovable  I  was  like,  I  needed  to  build  an  app  to  learn  this  style.  So  now  it's  public,  anybody  can  see  it,  it's  like  some  UI  style,  dolo  level  app,  I  don't  know  what  it  is,  like  it  has  like  18  different  styles  and  prompts  to  replicate  them,  so  like  learn  what  good  design  means,  learn  all  the  design  styles,  learn  how  to  prompt  to  get  them  is  probably  what  I  would,  what  I  would  optimize  for  at  this  stage.  Yeah,  while  we're  on  this  topic. 
**Speaker 2**: what's  your  sense  of  just  engineering  as  a  function?  Do  you  feel  like  there  will  be  a  future  where  software  engineers  are  still  thinking,  do  you  feel  like  that  goes  away . 
**Speaker 1**: based  on  your  experience  it  never  goes  away,  we  will  need  elite  engineering  more  than  ever  like  because  let  me  tell  you  this,  in  a  world  where  everybody  builds  and  everybody's  building  everything,  who's  doing  the  maintenance,  right,  taing  code  bases,  scaling  code  bases,  maintaining  projects,  you  know,  they're  still  going  to  be  a  thing  definitely,  and  obviously  AI  is  going  to  be  good  at  this,  but  again,  that  requires  a  different  level  of  skills,  it's  1  skill  to  build  something.  It's  a  completely  different  set  of  skills  to  expand  it,  expand  it  and  maintain  it,  and  not  to  mention  that  in  a  world  where  everybody's  building  infrastructure  suffers,  right?  Like  we  all  know  an  experience  like  Cloudflare  went  down  two  or  three  times  in  the  last  two  or  three  months,  the  whole  internet  goes  down.  Elite  engineers  are  the  ones  fixing  this  lovable  experiences  massive  amounts  of  influxes  of  new  users  in  their  sufferers. Elite  engineers  are  the  ones  building  the  infrastructure  to  hold  the  fort,  right?  So  like,  I  think  we're  going  to  need  a  lot  of  people  with  really  good  skills  of  like,  hey,  who  actually  builds  the  world  that  needs  to  support  billions  of  builders  now  because  everybody's  gon  na  want  to  learn  how  to  build  stuff?  Like  how  do  we  teach  them?  How  do  we  maintain  everything  that  they  need?  The  hosting,  the  security,  the  email,  the  connectors,  the  Apis,  the  whatnots,  like  so  I  think  there's  going  to  be  room  for  it,  but  I'm  also  on  the  boat  of  people  like  if  I  had  an  18  year  old  brother  and  he  asked  me  what  should  I  do,  I  would  tell  him,  hey,  go  become  a  plumber.  Don't  go  and  get  a  CS  degree.  You  learn,  learn  a  good  trade,  you  know,  because  the  new  generation  of  millionaires  in  the  us  are  actually  electricians  and  plumbers  and  whatnot,  right?  So  it's  like,  you  know,  it's  a  balancing  act  I'd  say  I  don't  know,  like  I  do  still  think  that  good  engineers  with  good  sense  of  like  understanding  where  the  future  is  going  are  always  going  to  be  needed  and  scarce. 
**Speaker 2**: Such  an  interesting  question.  I  think  to  your  point,  there's  definitely  going  to  be  people  need  to  keep  building  the  machines  that  power  all  this  stuff.  Well,  we  need  engineers  to  build  the  actual  products,  the  application  layer's,  that's  the  question.  Like,  is  everyone  going  to  be  like  you?  Is  everyone  going  to  be  our  designers? 
**Speaker 1**: Is  just  gonna  be  all  we  need?  Everybody's  gonna  become  an  engineer  and  let's  send  them,  let's  speak  to  that  and  like  I'm  AI  feel  like  i'm  a  rapid  engineer,  like  I'll  refer  to  myself  as  as  a  rapid  engineer  in  a  year  from  now  because  vibe  coding  is  just  coding  until  months  from  now,  even  today  we  spoke  about  this  before  like  how  many  elite  elite  engineers  are  publicly  admitting  they're  no  longer  hand  coding  or  manually  coding  whatever  you  want  to  call  it?  They  AI  writes  all  the  code.  I  use  analogy  here  of  like  coding  is  going  to  be  like  calligraphy  you  writing  code  is  going  to  be  the  equivalent  of  like  you  write,  you  find  printing  like  on  on  a  canvas  and  people  that,  oh  my  God,  you  wrote  that  code.  That's  so  amazing.  It's  gonna  be  so  rare  that  it's  gonna  become  an  art,  right?  It's  not  gonna  be,  it's  gonna  be  commoditized  completely  like  it,  it  already  is  in  a  sense,  most  elite  vibe  coders  rely  on  AI. Again,  it's  an  amplifier,  right?  So  I  think  everybody  becomes  an  engineer  in  the  world  of  the  future,  a  designer,  a  PM,  everybody  is  a,  an  A  for  deployed  engineer  or  an  air  assistant  engineer  or  an  LM  engineer  or  a  vibe  corner,  the  term  is  irrelevant.  We  all  using  Lll  MS  for  raw  output  based  on  good  judgment  or  bad  judgment?  Man. 
**Speaker 2**: essentially  these  Venn  diagrams  of  engineer  design  Rpm,  they're  used  to  be  very  separate.  Now  they're  converging  and  people  with  a  specific  with  deeper  PM  engineering  design  background  are  gon  na  like  they  can  all  do  the  same  thing.  Essentially  all  the  roles  are  converging.  What  a  what  a  time  to  be  alive  and  it's  so  hard  to  predict  exactly  how  this  all  goes,  but,  but  it's  fun  to  pontificate.  I  want  to  get  back  to  when  you  get  blocked.  Speaking  of  elite  engineers,  things,  this  is  like  in  the  in  reality,  you're  still  writing  code  using  these  tools,  sometimes  code  goes,  things  go  wrong,  bugs  are  introduced,  there's  a  weird  database  thing,  there's  like  some  network  issue,  what  do  you  do  when  you  get  stuck?  You  have  kind  of  a  workflow,  you  go  through . 
**Speaker 1**: unblocking  yourself.  Yes,  great  question,  and  I  absolutely  true,  like  no  matter  how  go  to  a  plan  you  have  in  place,  you're  going  to  run  into  problems  eventually  and  I  have  like  a  small  little  framework  that  I  call  4  by  4,  just  again  analogies,  right  4  by  4  if  you  if  you  have  it  on  your  car,  you're  gon  na  get  yourself  out  of  the  mud  much  easier  than  than  the  other  way  around.  So  in  that  sense,  four  different  ways  to  debug,  attempt  one  of  each  only  once  and  I'll  explain  why  in  the  end,  first  one  is  again,  every  tool  is  different  I'll  reference  lovable  is  workflow,  which  is  when  something  breaks  lovable  is  agent  is  smart  enough  to  say,  hey,  I  made  a  mistake,  it  will  label  that  message  in  orange  and  have  this  little  button  usually,  which  is  called  try  to  fix.  So  your  agent  basically  admits  it  made  a  mistake,  you  click  on  a  button  and  most  times  when  it's  a  smaller  issue,  it  corrects  the  course  fixes  it,  no  problem,  right  now  there  are  situations,  obviously,  when  the  problem  is  a  little  bit  deeper  than  that,  right?  You  clip  to  try  to  fix,  but  the  problem  persists,  and  sometimes  even  the  problem  persists,  but  Lobos  agents  unaware  that  it  persisted,  so  there's  no  more  try  to  fix  button. Lowell  thinks  everything's  working,  but  in  reality  it  isn't,  and  the  culprit  there  is  usually  you're  using  a  third  party  integration.  You  did  not  give  enough  context  to  Lo  where,  what  to  observe  and  what  to  see.  So  you  can't  see  that  the  problem  exists  because  lovable  cursor,  cloth  code,  you  name  it,  all  of  these  tools  are  good  enough  today  to  fix  any  problem  they're  aware  of. Again,  awareness  is  the  key  here,  right?  So  when  they're  unaware  of  it,  there  comes  the  second  part,  which  is,  okay,  I  need  to  bring  the  awareness  layer.  And  what  I  do  there  is  I  go  and  very  simply  open  the  preview  sandbox  dev  environment  of  my  app,  whatever,  try  to  run  the  function  that's  broken,  right  click,  read  the  console  log,  right? Every,  every  browser  allows  you  to  just  go  and  read  the  console  login.  A  lot  of  times  it  will  record  stuff.  If  it  doesn't,  you  can  prompt  any  tool  and  say,  hey,  I  don't  think  you're  seeing  the  problem.  So  instead  I'll  be  yelling  at  you,  let's  find  it  together,  right? I  think  it's  a  problem  with  XYZ.  I  want  you  to  write  console  logs  in  relevant  files  so  that  we  can  monitor  every  step  along  the  way.  Let's  just  bring  awareness  layer  into  the  equation.  It  writes  the  console  logs,  you  rerun  it,  guess  what?  Now  you  have  a  cool  history  of  everything  that  was  happening.  You  copy  that,  you  paste  it  inside  your  chat  99%  of  the  time,  that's  enough,  that's,  that's  already  enough.  I  was  like,  okay,  got  it,  found  it  fixed,  right?  But  then  there  are  situations  when  even  that's  not  sufficient.  So  you're  like,  okay,  I  need  to  go  even  deeper.  And  that's  where  like  code  reviews  and  evaluations  come  into  play. My  go  to  tool  today  for  that  is  Codex  OpenAI,  right?  What  I  do  is  like  any,  any  build  that  I  do,  I  will  export  it  to  GitHub,  like  Lobo  allows  you  to  own  your  code  cursor  as  well.  All  of  these  tools  allow  you  to  have  a  copy  of  the  code  that  you  can  export  to  GitHub  and  then  import  it  into  wherever  you  want  to.  So  I,  you  know,  use  Codex  since  beta,  like  import  it  in  there,  and  then  I'm  using  an  external  tool.  I'm  like  in  the  first  try  if  you  remember  I  use  the  tool  and  I  was  like  total  vibes  I  I'm  relying  on  the  tool,  right?  In  the  second  try,  I  use  myself  as  the  awareness,  a  facilitator.  In  the  third  one  I'm  using  an  external  tool  as  a  facilitator,  which  is  like  I'll  either  connect  to  Codex  and  chat  with  codecs  to  then  fix  the  problem  in  lovable,  right? I  don't  allow  Codex  to  make  code  changes  for  me.  A  lot  of  people  will  say,  why  don't  you  like?  It's  a  good,  good  model?  I  just  don't  know  it's  agent  well  enough,  like  I  don't  want  to  go  and  use  a  tool  that  I  don't  know  how  to  steer.  So  I  use  it  only  for  diagnostic  purposes  and  I'll  also  do  it  manually. It's  an  old  workflow  that  I  had  before  codec  and  before  Cloud  Code,  which  is  there's  a  tool  called  Repo  Mix,  which  allows  you  to  like  compress  every  your  entire  code  base  into  a  single  file.  You  download  it,  and  then  I  upload  it  to  Cloud,  just  regular  cloud  or  ChatGPT.  And  I'm  like,  this  is  what  I'm  building,  read  it.  And  this  is  the  problem  that  I  have,  These  are  the  console  logs. Again,  it's  almost  like  having  an  external  consultant  at  that  point,  like  you're  hiring  help  elsewhere  because  your  team  just  can't  handle  it,  right?  And  then  the  fourth  one  is,  is  usually  the  best  one  because  of  the  time  when  there  are  problems.  It's  my  fault.  Like  no  matter  how  your  ego  is  big  guys  that  you're  watching  this,  it's  your  fault.  Trust  me,  you  have  a  bad  prompt.  You  premised  your  request  in  the  wrong  way.  You  just  don't  want  to  admit  it  or  you  can't  remember  that  you  did,  but  it's  your  fault.  So  again,  in  lovable  and  all  these  other  tools,  you  can  revert  back.  There's  version  control  built  into  lovable  cursor  Cloud  Code. You  go  and  say,  okay,  I  tried  these  three  things,  and  I'm  just  going  to  take  three  steps  back,  and  I'm  going  to  think  about  my  prompt  a  little  bit  more.  Take  a  couple  breaths,  go  for  a  walk,  have  some  coffee,  come  back  with  a  clear  mind  and  try  again.  Because  guess  what? AI  is  just  writing  code  very  fast,  and  sometimes  it  stumbles  on  a  very  small  rock  and  it  only  happens  then  and  never  again.  So  you  just  got  Ta  make  the  same  request  again.  It  usually  that  just  fixes  the  problem.  It's  just  a  snag,  it's  a  syntax  error,  it's  something  minute,  right?  And  then  I  do  the  final  thing,  which  is  this,  and  this  is  the  key  one.  Actually,  when  the  problem  gets  fixed,  I  go  into  the  chat  mode  and  I  ask,  lo,  I  say,  okay,  I  needed  to  do  four  different  things  to  fix  this. How  can  you  help  me  learn  how  to  prompt  you  better  so  that  next  time  I  have  a  problem,  we  do  it  in  one  go,  99%  of  the  time?  I  get  such  a  great  answer  that  I  don't  have  the  problem  of  not  knowing  what  to  do  next  time,  right?  Again,  we  all  need  to  be  aware  and  realistic. These  tools  are  so  good  at  doing  things  the  right  way.  If  they  are  used  the  right  way,  it's  always  our  fault.  It's  100,  I  say  90%,  but  honestly,  it's  100%  our  fault,  right?  Because  they're  good  enough.  It's  just  that  I'm  not  dynamically  shifting  token  allocation,  I  didn't  reference  the  right  file,  I  didn't  say  it  the  right  way.  For  me  as  a  non  designer,  I  don't  know  any  of  the  terminology,  like  none  of  the  headings  and  whatnots,  and  I  still  don't  know  it  to  this  day.  So  when  i'm,  I  struggle  with  prompts,  a  lot  of  times  I  use  chat  mode  to  help  me  craft  a  good  prompt.  Wait,  anybody  can  do  this  too. If  you  are  just  stuck,  it's  10 PM  and  you  don't  know  what  to  ask,  switch  to  chat  mode,  brain  dump  and  be  like,  help  me  draft  a  better  prompt,  help  me  prompt  you  better,  and  let  the  tool  effectively  prompt  itself.  A  lot  of  times  you're  going  to  solve  your  problem  by  not  introducing  them  at  all  with  with  bad  inputs. 
**Speaker 2**: So  oh  my  God,  everything  you  share,  so  interesting.  I  just  want  to,  I  want  to  keep  digging.  So  just  to  reflect  back  the  sequence,  and  then  I  want  to  follow. But  another  question,  the  sequence  you  go  through  when  you  get  stuck,  which  is  going  to  happen  to  everyone,  one  is  just  ask  the  tool  to  try  to  fix  it.  And  oftentimes  it's  telling  you  something  is  wrong.  Can  I  fix  it  for  you?  And  you're  like,  please  fix.  Sometimes  that'll  work. Two  is  work  on  adding  more  debugging  messages  to  the  console  log.  And  this  advice  I  love  of  just  ask  it  to  add  more  debugging  lines  to  itself  and  console  log  to  help  see  what's  going  on,  and  then  you  can  ask  it,  Okay,  now  that  you're  looking  watch,  look  at  all  the  output  of  your  console  log,  see  if  you  can  help  find  the  problem. And  then  step  3  is  go  to  Codex,  which  is,  which  is  so  funny.  And  I  hear  this  a  lot,  that  Codex  is  like  the  most  elite  engineer  as  an  AI  kpoi  tweeted  this  once  that  we  had  the  head  of  Codex  on  the  podcast  too,  by  the  way,  that  he's  like,  anytime  I  have  the  most  gnarly  bug,  I  just  go  to  Codex,  let  run  for  half  an  hour,  and  it  solves  it  unlike  any  other  two  author.  And  so  it  makes  sense  that  that's  where  you  go.  So  the  idea  here  is  you  point  Codex  to  your  code,  you  showed  all  the  console,  all  output  logs,  tell  it  what  the  problem  is,  and  just  have  it  go  figure  it  out,  sweet.  And  then  the  final  step  is  so  great.  And  this  is  where  I  want  to  go  that  use  this  as  a  learning  opportunity  so  that  next  time  you  solve  the  problem  more  quickly  or  avoid  it  completely. So  what  you  do  there  is  you  ask  the  agent,  okay,  here's  what  happened,  what  can  I  do?  What  could  I  have  said?  How  could  have  prompted  you  better  to  have  gotten  this  immediately  solved? 
**Speaker 1**: And  then  even  more  even  deeper  than  that  is  like  once  you  go  through  this  conversation,  you're  like,  okay,  let  me  eliminate  myself  again,  completely  out  of  the  equation  because  I  won't  remember  to  prompt  you  better  two  days  from  now.  Put  this  into  rules.  Put  this  what  we  just  learned  into  rules.  Do  MD,  because  I'm  making  you  read  the  rules  every  time  anyways,  so  you  might  as  well  just  record  it  there.  So  I'm  not  going  prompt  you  better.  You're  just  going  to  learn  that  I'm  stupid  and  you're  going  to  prompt  yourself  better,  right?  Again,  just  eliminate  yourself  and  move  the  context,  You  solve  99%  of  the  problems  with  AI  today. 
**Speaker 2**: So  I  here  is  help  it  build  its  own  brain  and  rules  and  way  of  thinking  based  on  problems  0  to  2.  So  great.  Okay,  so,  so  I'm  going  to  come  back  to  this  point  you've  made  a  couple  times,  which  are  so  interesting,  this  idea  that  you  watch  the  output  of  the  agent  to  learn  what  is  going  on. There's  something  I've  seen  other  people,  Ben  tossell,  who  I  think  is  a  factory  now  share  this  recently.  He's  also  basically  vibe  coding  all  the  time.  He  was  brilliant  into  no  code  tools  before  and  now  he's  all  about  vibe  coding  and  he  shared  basically  like  he's  learning  how  things  how  coding  works  and  learning  how  systems  work  by  watching  the  agent  output. And  this  connects  to  something  Michael  Turrell  shared  the  CEO  cursor  when  he  was  on  the  podcast.  He  had  this  vision  of  cursor  becoming  basically  what  comes  after  code,  what's  the  layer  that  we  are  adding  on  top  of  code  where  people  don't  need  to  worry  about  code  anymore?  And  at  that  point  it  was  like  a  year  ago  that  we  chatted.  And  it  feels  like  this  is  the  layer  is  the  agent  conversation  of  what  it,  it's  what  it's  thinking  and  then  what  you  tell  it  back.  So  essentially  it's  English  in  a  conversation,  which  is  like,  it's  not  even  pseudocode.  It's  interesting,  but  that's  where  it  feel  feels  like  things  are  heading.  The  layer  over  code  is  just  it's  thinking  and  your  conversation  with  it. 
**Speaker 1**: Yeah,  exactly.  I  mean,  again,  in  a  way,  I  really  optimize  for  good  judgment.  And  part  of  good  judgment  is  it  comes  from,  again,  learning  how  these  tools  work. You  need  to  know  what's  possible.  We  talked  about  it,  and  I  know  I  made  some  contradictory  sometimes,  right?  But  it's  because  as  you  said,  it's  so  interesting  the  world  we  live  in  that  things  contradict  to  each  other.  It's  an  advantage  not  to  know  what's  possible.  But  then  at  the  same  time,  you  can  not  be  completely  oblivious  to  something  that's  like  a  fact  shielding.  So  let  me  talk  about  a  failure  of  mine  that  came  from  being  delusional  back  in  the  day  when  OpenAI  started  or  released  image  generation  natively  in  the  app,  right?  So  you  could  go  to  ChatGPT  and  be  like,  generate  an  image  of  XYZ,  the  whole  world  exploded,  like  that  was  like  the  biggest  thing  ever. Obviously,  first  thing  that  comes  to  my  mind  is  like,  I  want  to  build  1  bla,  bla,  bla  app.  I  just  want  to  build  a  rapper  and  I  want  to  build  an  image  gen  with  loveable  without  thinking  that  OpenAI  did  not  release  an  API  for  that  just  yet.  So  I  spent  at  least  a  week  trying  to  brute  my  force,  brute  force  my  way  into  making  this  work  instead  of  just  waiting  for  another  week.  Because  a  week  later,  they  had  an  API  and  I  built  this  up  in  30  seconds.  The  problem  was  that  like  I  tried  to  do  it  when  it  was  impossible,  impossible,  like  so. I  think  again,  you  know,  it's  just  a  matter  of  really  learning  what's  possible  through  communicating  with  the  agent  layer  and  lovable  and  all  the  other  tools  are  empty  now,  which  means  like  they  will  just  write  code,  they  can  browse  the  web,  they  can  read  files,  they  have  reasoning  and  thinking  capabilities.  So  that's  why  I'm  so  invested  into  that  conversation  because  a  lot  of  times  it  will  tell  me,  hey,  what  you're  trying  to  do  is  just  undoable  at  the  moment  because  of  XYZ.  So  like,  I  always  use  those,  as  a  learning  opportunity  and  I  just  level  up  most  by  being  in  chat  mode  for  planning  and  learning  purposes.  And  because  it  just,  again,  develops  your  clarity,  your  judgment  capabilities  rather  than  coding  capabilities. Yeah. 
**Speaker 2**: the  other  point  you  made  here  that  I  think  is  really  important  is  that  over  time,  these  tools  will  do  more  and  more  of  what  you  do  manually.  I've  heard  this  from  other  people  that  are  doing  this  full  time-time,  basically  vibe  codings,  just  they  had  all  these  workflows,  all  these  files,  and  then  cursor  ads,  them,  lovable  ads  them,  and  it's  like  sad.  Oh  shoot,  I  had  this  cool  workflow  and  now,  but  on  the  other  hand,  it's  like,  okay. 
**Speaker 1**: now  I  was  just  doing  all  these  psychosomatics  a  year  ago,  A  year  ago,  if  we  had  an  interview,  your  mind  would  be  blow.  Stuff  that  I  had  to  do  is  work  around  for  two  to  address  shortcomings,  like  I've  built  a  very  successful  course  on  that  with  starter  story,  like  for  a  year,  people  were  like  just,  oh  my  God,  you're  the  only  guy  in  the  world  that  knows  this  secret.  Now  Lovable  natively  addresses  99%  of  it.  I  can  almost  say  most  of  the  stuff  that  I  was  teaching  people  or  like  I  have  a  YouTube  channel  a  little  bit  appreciated,  but  like  there's  a,  there's  a  like  a  seven  day  learn  how  to  vibe  code  with  lovable  series  that  I  did  in March. Completely  obsolete.  Like  it.  None  of  it  is  true.  None  of  it  is  a  problem  anymore. All  the  things  that  I  was  like,  oh,  well,  this  is  missing  and  that  is  missing,  It's  not  missing  anymore.  It's  natively  in  the  product,  like  you  don't  have  to.  Work  your  way  around  it.  It,  it  just  works,  right?  So  that's  why,  as  I  say,  like  it's  the,  it's  the  horse's  analogy,  I  don't  know  if  you've  of  it,  like  a  lot  of  people  are  fleeting  about  it,  which  is  like  we  started  building  the  Steam  Machine  in  17  hundreds,  right?  Took  us  about  200  years  to  build  it.  It  when  engines  got  built  in,  cars  were  put  on  the  roads.  I  think  that  90%  of  horse  population  was  got  eradicated  in  the  us  within  20  years. The  person  that  tweeted  this  works  at  Claude  Code,  right?  So  he  was  like,  now  when  I  translated  into  AI,  I  was  hired  to  do  a  job,  technical  job,  technical  writer,  whatever.  I  became  obsolete  six  months  later.  Like  humans  did  not  get  the  20  years  that  horses  did. The  guy  that  that  is  was  hired  to  do  a  thing  is  like  six  months  later,  I  need  to  reinvent  my  role.  I  need  to  involve  it  into  into  something  else,  right?  So,  you  know,  I  think  there's  just  an  evolution  that's  coming  really,  really  fast.  But  like  a  lot  of  people  are  scared  when  I'm  just  super  excited  because  don't  you  see?  Our  roles  are  finally  going  in  a  direction  where  we're  outsourcing  what  we  hated  doing  anyways,  right?  Sitting  in  meetings,  taking  notes,  doing  spreadsheets,  like  nobody,  maybe  there  are  people  that  like  that,  but  like  most  people  don't,  we're  just  giving  it  to  a  place  where  we're  rewarded  for  what  really  matters,  like  clarity,  judgment,  thinking  we're  actually  going  to  be  paid  to  think  longer  and  ponder  longer  because  the  longer  idea  simmers,  that  gets  broken  down  the  better  because  building  it  is  going  to  be  an  instant,  it's  going  to  be  like  this,  it's  just  a  matter  of  you  having  so  much  clarity  around  it  because  guess  what? If  a  tool  is  super  powerful  and  you  give  it  a  wrong  input,  the  output  is  gonna  suck  as  well,  that's  why  like  I  never  become  good  enough  at  Claude  code,  I  feel  I  don't  start  my  projects  with  enough  clarity  and  the  tool  is  so  powerful  that  like  I  just  misdirected  completely  from  the  get  go,  and  I  was  like,  oh  shoot,  this  is  not  what  I  wanted  to  do.  So  that's  why  I  still  see  myself  being  good  at  like  using  tools  that  are,  a  little  bit  on  the  exploratory  prototyping  path,  more  than  like  on  the  path  that,  yeah,  elite  engineers  would  use,  for  example. 
**Speaker 2**: I  love  your  optimism  and  excitement  about  this  stuff,  I  think  for  a  lot  of  people  say  their  current  software  engineers  Pms,  designers,  there's  a  lot  of  fear  about  the  future  of  their  careers.  Are  they  going  to  be  relevant?  Well,  my  software  engineering  skills  disappear  so  to  follow  the  story  a  little  bit  if  you  are  to  give  someone  advice  on  which  skills  you  think  will  be  most  valuable  slash  where  AI  will  take  on  more  and  more,  this  kind  of  momentum  you're  seeing  of  where  AI  is  filling  in  more  and  more  gaps,  what  would  your  advice  be  of  what  you  think  people  should  focus  on?  What  will  continue  to  be  valuable  in  the  future? 
**Speaker 1**: Yeah,  emotional  intelligence  for  sure,  just  understanding  human  nature,  real  life  stuff.  I  think  we're  all  going  to  get  so  tired  of  everything,  fake,  fake  images,  fake  posts,  fake  profiles,  fake  this,  fake  that,  fake  videos,  everything  is  becoming  fake  and  AI  generated.  I  think  humans  just  craving  humans  naturally  are  going  to  want  to  do  live  stuff  more.  So  anything  human  to  human,  it's  going  to  be  a  big  thing  to  scale  up  on,  understand  the  dynamics,  anything  regarding  math,  if  it's  a  math  problem,  I  think  Peter  Steel  said  it  recently,  like  people  that  just  do  math  stuff,  you  know  AI  is  going  to  come  for  you,  like  anything  that's  very  deterministic,  meaning  X  input  equals  y  output.  And  it's  pretty  clear,  the  line  is  pretty  clear  AI  has  got  cheating  eaten  for  lunch,  right?  If  you  understand  how  x  to  y  goes  in  human  dynamic  human  relationship  layer,  I  think  that's  where  things  are  going  to  become  good.  So  if  you  translate  it  again  to  a  specific  skill  I'll  say  it  again,  good  design,  really  good  design,  great  design,  like  how?  And  I  say  design,  that's  images,  fonts  as  well. Copy,  copy  is  a  big  one,  like  we  all  now  we're  arere,  like  two  years  into  AI.  I'll  bet  you  me  and  you  if  people  put  10  pieces  of  copy  in  front  of  us,  we  could  tell  what's  AI  and  what  isn't  in  like  3  seconds.  And  we're  all  a  couple  years  in.  So  like  really  good  copy  writing  is  going  to  be  a  very  good  skill  to  have  because  I  was  just  going  to  know  after  three  words  or  three  sentences  that  it's  AI  written.  And  even  I  don't  read  AI  output  anymore.  I  don't  like  to  see. I  want  that  raw  human  experience,  human  skills.  I  don't  even  know  how  to  describe  it  because  I  don't  don't  think  we're  doing  an  awesome  job  putting  labels  onto  what  humans  are  good  at  natively,  but  I  think  we  will.  I  think  we  will  describe  job  descriptions  better.  We  will  have  like  human  first  engineers,  I  don't  know,  or  human  desires  or  I  don't  know  how  to  describe  those  roles. Same  way  how  Kapai  coined  vibe  coding.  I  was  vibe  coding  before  he  did  it.  I  didn't  know  how  to  call  it,  like  I  started  vibe  coding  in  July 2024,  and  I  think  he  coined  it  it  sometime  in  early  2025,  so  I  was  like  doing  it  for  seven  months  and  I  was  teaching  people  how  to  do  it  for  about  3  or  four  with  courses,  and  I  didn't  even  know  how  to  call  it  like  because  there  was  no  name. I  was  like,  oh  I'm  just  using  AI  to  do  this  for  me,  I  don't  know,  whatever.  So  yeah,  I  think  we're  going  to  reinvent  some  of  the  terms  roles  and  whatnot,  but  stuff  that's  like  human  to  human  is  here  to  stay.  Stuff  that's  like,  I  think  like,  oh,  you're,  you're  just  doing,  you're,  you're  a  middle  manager,  you're  a  middle  where  person  that's  just  translating  stuff. And  I  can  use  that  analogy  again,  Translators  are  going  to  die,  people  writing  jokes,  comedians  are  not.  AI  is  never  going  to  be  able  to  write  a  good  joke.  Never,  never,  never,  just  doesn't  have  that  layer  that  just  doesn't  understand  what's  funny.  Like  if  you  ever  try  to  use  AI  to  write  jokes  like  they're  awful,  they're  always  going  to  be  awful.  But  if  you  use  AI  to  translate  things  from  one  language  to  another,  it's  very  good  at  it. Like  AI  is  going  to  replace  translators,  it's  going  to  replace  most  journalists  because  it  does  good  research,  it  can  write  good  copy,  whatever,  not  not  elite  journalism.  It's  not  going  to  be  able  to  replace  all  the  writers.  It's  going  to  amplify  great  writers  that  can  train  AI  on  how  to  write  books.  So  like  somebody  who's  an  amazing  writer  is  going  to  all  of  a  sudden  write  seven  books  a  year  instead  of  one,  right?  So  that's  dense,  dangerous. If  you're  an  average  raer,  be  careful.  There's  zero  comedians  placed  0.  And  that's  just  my  personal  belief,  like  AI  is  never  going  to  write  good  comedy,  it's  impossible.  And  like  so  try  to  find  your  analogy  in  your  industry,  like  I  just  gave  you  one  for  writing  skills,  so  to  speak.  So  writing  jokes,  super  good  skill  to  have,  translating.  I'm  sorry  to  say,  but  like  you're  not  going  to  have  a  job  for  much  longer,  like  you  better  find  something  else  to  do.  But  yeah,  that's,  that's  how  I  look  at  it. 
**Speaker 2**: The  comedy  piece  is  interesting.  I  had  one  of  the  founders  of  the  data  label  billing  company,  I  don't  know,  was  mercorella,  maybe  Serge.  And  he  said  that  I  think  it  was.  Anthropic,  hired  a  bunch  of  National  Lampoon  comedy  writers  to  help  them  train  models.  And  so  they're  working  on  it.  And  so  I  love  this  strong  prediction  he  made.  I'm  so  curious  in  a  year  to  look  back  and  be  like  he  was  completely  right  or  no,  they  got  that  one  too. 
**Speaker 1**: I'll  be  wrong  on  95  of  the  things  I  said  today,  three  months  from  now.  That  is  the  only  thing  I  can  say  very,  very  confidently. 
**Speaker 2**: Yeah,  that  seems  right.  Okay,  so  speaking  of  career,  so  one  interesting  career  option  is  to  do  what  you're  doing.  As  you  said,  this  is  a  dream  job  for  you,  it's  a  dream  job  for  so  many  people.  What,  what  is  the  kind  of  your  path  to  this  job  and  what  do  you  think  it  takes  for  someone  to  actually  do  this  as  a  profession? 
**Speaker 1**: Well,  my  personal  path  and  personal  journey  was  anything  but  linear,  like  I've  done  so  many  things  in  life,  like  Kang  blue  collar  jobs  looked  at  even  at  Subway  while  I  was  studying  and  stuff  like  that,  like  I'm  an  engineer  by  trade,  but  not  a  software  engineer.  I'm  a  forestry  engineer,  so  no  coding,  but  still  engineering  is  engineering.  I  feel  you  still  develop  certain  set  of  skills  doing  that.  I  weigh  the  tables  a  long  time,  so  you  develop  some  human  skills,  you  understand  what  people  like  what  they  don't  like,  right?  I've  again,  blue  collar  jobs  like  teach  hard  work  and  like  it's  as  I  said,  the  path  was  not  linear,  but  I  feel  almost  like  a  slum  dog  millionaire.  The  movie  storyline,  which  is  like  everything  that  happens  to  the  character,  brings  them  into  a  position  to  be  able  to  answer  the  questions  in  the  quiz  better. I  have,  I  feel  the  same  way  of  like  I've  done  a  lot  of  stuff  last  7  to  8  years,  obviously  spent  in  startups,  but  doing  everything  but  code  writing  like  started  in  like  community  management,  social  media. Again,  distribution  matters  a  lot.  That's  something  we  haven't  touched  upon  at  all,  like  in  a  world  where  everybody's  building  and  there's  roughly  the  same  amount  of  consumers  in  the  world,  how  do  you  get  in  front  of  the  eyeballs,  right,  and  get  attention,  which  is,  is  the  most  scarce  resource?  And  it  will  be  even  more  scarce.  But  like  going  back  to  the  bytecode  role,  if  somebody's  like  saying,  okay,  well,  have  I  have  a  pretty  diverse  background  too?  And  I'm  vibe  coding  and  like,  how,  how  does  this  become  a  job?  Well,  for  me,  I  feel  like  it  became  a  job  by  building  in  public. I  did  chat  with  Elena  once,  only  once.  So  like,  why  me?  There  are  so  many  good  vibe  codes  I  did.  How  did  you  pick  me  out  of  the  crowd?  And  I  think,  you  know,  obviously,  you  know,  she  gave  me  a  couple  of  reasons,  but  like  to  translate  it  into  like  a  one  concept,  it  was  like  I  was  building  in  public  and  sharing. I,  as  I  said,  I  made  a  YouTube  channel  and  up,  I  shared  all  the  failures  and  all  the  knowledge,  all  the  projects  that  I  was  building.  I  use  social  media  a  lot,  like  LinkedIn  was  my  go  to  because  I  just  have  that  type  of  cadence  as  you  can  see  all  my  in  is  very  long  and  X  doesnt  doesn't  cut.  And  for  that  like  you  need,  you  know,  you  need  to  be  very  to  on  point  to  be  successful  at  X,  so  I'm  not,  so  I  guess,  you  know,  it's  just  like  in  public  share  your  knowledge,  give  away  all  the  secrets  like  there  are  no  secrets  whatsoever.  If  you're  sitting  on  a  good  concept,  you're  missing  out,  let's  share  it  immediately  if  you  figure  something  out.  That  I  recognize  that  very  early  on.  And,  you  know,  just  like  I  think  a  lot  of  people  participate  in  hackathons  these  days,  I  want  to  encourage  people  to  do  them,  like  find  those,  those  opportunities  locally  to  connect  with  other  builders. Lovable  is  hiring  across  the  board.  Check  out  our  open  positions,  it's  as  easy  as  that,  right?  Like  just  apply,  really  find  companies  that  that  are  hiring  and  hiring  in  different  roles.  I've  seen  people  do  something.  I'm  going  to  give  people  a  secret  away.  A  couple  of  hires  stood  up  by  not  sending  resumes,  but  sending  lovable  apps.  They  build  lovable  apps  to  show  what  they're,  why  they're  good  fit  for  a  role  and  we  as  lovable  employees  will  always  open  an  app  that  uses  lovable  Dot  app  domain  always. If  you  send  me  a  DM,  send  me  a  lovable  app.  Don't  send  me  anything  along,  send  me  an  app  that  tells  me  what  what  you  want  for  me  or  how  do  you  see  us  collaborating  and  working  together,  right?  So  there's  people  finding  creative  ways  to  get  in  front  of  eyeballs  of  decision  makers  like  Elena,  right?  And,  I  mean,  skill  wise,  again,  we're  just  repeating  ourselves  here,  but  I  think  it's  important  to  repeat  it  as  many  times  as  possible,  really  develop  good  judgment,  right? Really  understand  in  a  deeper  sense  how  how  things  translate  when  Y  Cody  comes  into  play,  right? There's  a  company  out  there.  I'm  not  going  to  name  them,  but  like  that  usss  lovable  religiously  is  going  to  be  one  of  our  main  case  studies  actually,  where  like  they  actually  hired  vibe  cos  before  lovable  that  like  I  am  the  first  official  vibe  coding  engineer  at  Lovable,  like  with  that  title.  But  I've  met  people  in  companies  where  they  hire  them  before  us,  people  that  are  just  5/4,  people  that  just  understand  that  speed  matters,  right?  It  still  matters  a  lot  to  be  fast  and  like  there's  a  company  out  there  with  free  web  coded  is  full  time.  All  they  do  is  like  translating  the  old  code  base  into  onto  lovable.  This  is  bringing  everything  there,  CRM  CMS  everything,  they  all  the  tool  sets  that  they  have  and  they  need,  there  are  people  now  actively  just  migrating  everything,  everything  over  theirs. SP  500  companies  that  are  like  putting  lovable  in  job  descriptions  too,  like  saying,  hey,  lovable  skills,  Skills  are,  you  know,  recommended  in  the  recommended  tab,  right?  So  yeah,  to  go  back  to  the  how  to  become  Vibe  coder  professionally,  well,  you  don't  need  a  company  to  hire  you.  You  can  hire  yourself  as  a  professional  vibe  coder  first.  I  think  the  reason  why  it  I  clicked  with  Anton  and  with  Elaine  and  everyone  else,  because  I  was  already  doing  it.  Like  all  I  did,  I  just  changed  the  vehicle,  but  I  was  already  doing  it  professionally  before  I  got  hired.  So  that's  kind  of  the  key,  like  do  the  job  you  would  have  done  anyways. 
**Speaker 2**: What  a  mind  expanding  and  conversation.  I  love  just  how  passionate  and  excited  and  motivated  you  are  about  all  this.  It  feels  like  there's  so  many  people  out  there  right  now  that  are  so  burnt  out,  I  don't  know,  disillusioned,  scared,  and  you're  the  opposite  of  that.  You're  just  leaning  into  this,  just  taking  advantage,  taking,  you're  not  sure  where  it's  going  to  go,  but  following  the  path. 
**Speaker 1**: Yeah,  I  don't  want  to  interrupt  you,  but  like  it's  because  like,  look,  lovable  specifically  isn't  a  company,  you  can  talk  about  it  as  a  company.  I  don't  see  it  as  a  company.  It's  a,  it's  an  idea,  it's  a  mission,  it's  something  more  powerful  than  the  internet  in  my  mind  because  Iter  allows  us  to  consume,  lovable,  allows  us  to  build.  And  in  our  nature  and  human  nature  is  to  build,  to  create,  right?  And  the  fact  that  there's  a  tool  today  that  you  can  go  into  and  dump  an  idea  in  and  somebody  comes  out  of  it  and  somebody  uses  it  and  finds  it  useful,  to  me,  it's  just  it's  the  craziest  concept  ever. It's  my  only  life's.  I  had  my  first  computer  when  I  was  six  and  I  was  convinced  my  whole  life  that  I'm  going  to  be  a  software  engineer  or  that  I'm  going  to  be  building.  But  like  life  wasn't  as  simple  as  that  for  me.  Like  it  was  very,  very  complicated.  And  honestly,  the  last  5  to  10  years,  I  gave  up  on  that  dream  almost.  I  thought  I'm  never  gon  na  build  anything  like  I've  tried,  like  I've  tried  to  build  with  technical  cosplayers,  like  I  just  couldn't  find  alignment.  I  was,  I  just  gave  up  on  it.  And  I  now  like  at  36,  like  30  years  later,  I  feel  like  again,  like  that  that  kid,  like  I  dream  every  day,  like  I,  it's  amazing  what  this  enable  us  to  do. And  I,  anybody  that's  scared,  like  just  try  it,  it  switches  from  fear  to  excitement  immediately  because  then  you  see  what's  possible  firsthand.  Just  go  in,  build  something,  build  anything,  and  the  fear  goes  away.  You  should  only  be  afraid  if  you're  doing  nothing.  If  you're  doing  absolutely  nothing,  yes,  be  terrified  by  all  means  be  terrified  and  then  take  a  step  towards  doing  something  about  it.  And  trust  me,  the  leap  is  no  longer  as  big  as  it  used  to  be.  It's  as  big  as  you  come  in  and  you  just  say  what's  on  your  mind  and  just  ship. 
**Speaker 2**: I  think  a  big  part  of  this  is  just  stop  listening  to  the  podcast  and  just  do  stuff  with  you  actually,  right? 
**Speaker 1**: Ideally,  people  stop  right  now.  They  heard  enough.  I  gave  them  what  I  gave  them  the  best  that  I  could,  just  stop  listening  and  just  go. 
**Speaker 2**: Alright,  bye  everyone.  Okay  I'm  just  joking,  but  let's  shall  wrap  it  up.  I'm  gonna  skip  the  lightning  round  just  to  keep  this  episode  shorter  Before  we  wrap  up,  is  there  anything  else  other  than  just  kill,  build  some  stuff?  Anything  else  you  want  to  say?  Anything  else  you  want  to  leave  listeners  with  otherwise  we'll  let  we'll . 
**Speaker 1**: let  you  go?  Yeah,  text  tag  doesn't  matter  anymore,  like  it  doesn't  matter  like  people  obsess  over  or  is  this  written  in  HTML,  is  this  written  in  React?  It  doesn't  matter,  like  never  matter  but  now  matters  even  less  the  end  user  just  wants  a  stellar  experience. We  live  in  a  world  where  anybody  can  produce  good  enough  so  you  better  start  learning  how  to  produce  magic  because  otherwise  you're  just  gonna  end  up  in  a  crowd  with  millions  and  millions  of  others.  But  at  the  same  time,  if  you  don't  know  what  magical  looks  like,  don't  be  discouraged  to  start  building  anything  and  start  from  good  enough  and  level  up. The  best  way  to  level  up  exposure  time,  Set  aside  more  time  on  learning  than  building.  Read  the  agent  output,  learn  how  it's  thinking  so  that  you  know  what's  possible,  but  then  also  go  and  get  inspired. Follow  good  designers  on  X,  find  tools  where  great  designs  are  produced,  and  follow  their  creators.  There's  a  tool  where  where  I'm  following  just  the  actual  person  that  built  it  because  he  publishes  videos  almost  daily,  40,  50  minutes  long  of  him  designing.  I  want  to  see  how  a  world  class  designer  doesn't.  I  want  to  see  him  talk  to  the  tool.  I  want  to  see  him  Cru.  And  that's  how  I  learned  to  become  better  at  it. So  again,  exposure  time,  just  deliberately  set  more  time  aside  to  learning  than  coding  because  you  can  code  fast,  but  you  can  code  garbage  fast  as  well  as  magic  fast.  It's  the  same  amount  of  time,  it's  you  and  your  input  that  matters.  Forget  about  decisions  on  tech  stack,  forget  about  which  backend  are  you  using,  which  front  end  are  you  using,  that  doesn't  matter,  Quality,  taste,  design,  that's  all  you  need  to  optimize  for  in  the  future  that's  ahead  of  us. 
**Speaker 2**: That's,  I  think  we're  going  to  leave  a  lot  of  a  lot  of  minds  buzzing  after  this  conversation,  Blow  my  mind  in  so  many  ways,  what  a  fascinating  topic,  conversation,  what  a  glimpse  into  the  future,  what  an  interesting  point  in  time.  I'm  so  curious,  just  you  know,  in  six  months  where  things  are  and  revisiting  this  conversation.  I  really  appreciate  you  coming  on,  sharing  all  of  this,  You're  awesome.  Where  can  folks  find  you  if  they  want  to  reach  out,  maybe  ask  some  follow  questions  and  how  can  listeners . 
**Speaker 1**: useful  to  you?  Awesome,  Yeah,  So,  I  mentioned  it  already.  LinkedIn  is  probably  the  best  place  to  find  me  on,  you  know  I'm  very  responsive  there.  If  you  want  to  follow  me,  I  hope  to  re-engage  my  YouTube  channel  a  little  bit  more.  I  think  I  have  a  lot  of  cool  tips  and  tricks  that  I  want  to  share  and  teach  people  how  to  use  lovable  and  just  vibe  code  in  general  and  level  up  and  on  how  people  can  be  useful  to  me. Well,  you  know  I'm  very  passionate  about  making  sure  that  everybody  experienced  is  what  I've  experienced  that  day  when  I  got  my  first  prompt.  And  I  envy  the  person  that  is  going  to  try  lovable  for  the  first  time  after  watching  this  episode  because  the  feeling  is  just  unmatched  of  you  going  from  a  consumer  to  a  builder.  But  in  that  process,  there's  going  to  be  some  battles  to  fight.  I  want  to  reduce  the  amount  of  those  battles  and  hurdles.  So  if  you  can  help  me  in  any  way,  message  me  what  could  have  been  better  in  that  experience,  especially  if  this  is  your,  you  just  watch  this  and  you're  like  I'm  going  to  do  it.  I  was  on  the  fence  and  I'm  going  to  do  it  If  something  breaks,  if  something  doesn't  connect  and  relate,  I  need  to  know  what  that  is. My  job  is  100%  to  empower  you  to  build  the  best  work  of  your  life.  And  I  need  to  say  this  too,  because  a  lot  of  people  may  be  inspired  not  by  building,  using  lovable,  but  but,  but  rather  building  lovable. Come  join  our  team.
